These are two great examples of countries missing of maps. 

The Welsh one is from a Eurostat report from 2004, reported by [the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3715512.stm) among others. The error wasn't spotted until the report came back from the printers, and supposedly Eurostat decided not to reprint the whole book, but included a paper insert, apologising for missing Wales! 

The New Zealand one is much more common and is usually because the very common usage of the Mercator projection leaves New Zealand at the very bottom right corner of any global maps, [risking being cropped off](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/new-zealand-left-off-world-map). It was even featured in a [New Zealand tourism advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HynsTvRVLiI), featuring comic Rhys Darby and New Zealand's (then) prime minster Jacinda Arden!

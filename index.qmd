I'm Dr Nick Bearman and deliver GIS training sessions and GIS consultancy for a variety of clients, primarily focused in the academic and not for profit sectors. I help people make use of GIS to answer their research questions, and get more answers from the data they already have.

I think GIS is a great way to explore and communicate your data, and I have a range of [training courses](training-courses.html), [training materials](training-courses.html), and [books](writing-presentations.html) to help people do this.

I am also a passionate supporter of Open Source software and am Chair of [OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/), the UK Local Chapter of the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](https://osgeo.org/)).

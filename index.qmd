I'm Dr Nick Bearman and deliver GIS training sessions and GIS consultancy for a variety of clients, primarily focused in the academic sector. I help people make use of GIS to answer their research questions, and get more answers from the data they already have.

I think GIS is a great way to explore and communicate your data, and I have a range of training materials, training courses and books to help people do this. I am also a passionate supporter of Open Source software and am Chair of OSGeo:UK, the UK Local Chapter of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation.

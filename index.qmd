I'm Dr Nick Bearman and I deliver GIS training sessions and GIS consultancy for a variety of clients, primarily focused in the academic and not for profit sectors. 

*I help people make use of GIS to answer their research questions, and get more answers from the data they already have.*

GIS is a great way to explore and communicate your data, and I have a range of [training courses](training-courses.html), [training materials](training-materials.html), and [books](writing-presentations.html) to help people do this. I also offer [consultancy](consultancy.html) services to help you.

Contact me using one of the methods above for more details. 

*If you want to learn more about what I do, check out this interview on [Geospatial Jobs](https://geospatial-jobs.com/2024/12/21/nick-bearman-geospatial-training-in-r/).*

## **What is GIS?**
Geographical Information Systems allows you to **combine**:

- **your data** which has location information (coordinates, address, etc.) 
- with **other data** with location information (population, land use, etc.) 
- to help you gain more **answers** from the data you already have. 

Check out the first chapters of my books (for free) for more details:

- [GIS: Research Methods ](gis-research-methods.html) 
- [Using R as a GIS](rgis.html)

## **Why Learn GIS?**

Geographical Information Systems can be used across virtually **any field**, from **environmental management** to **space exploration**. 

Learning GIS transforms how you work with data by developing **spatial intelligence**, critical data skills, and visual communication abilities that enable you to **link datasets**, evaluate effectiveness, and **tell compelling stories through maps**.

See [Why Learn GIS?](why-learn-gis.html) to find out why you should learn GIS and how to get started.

I completed my PhD at [University of East Anglia](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-environmental-sciences) in 2011. 

I am a passionate supporter of Open Source software and am Chair of [OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/), the UK Local Chapter of the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](https://osgeo.org/).

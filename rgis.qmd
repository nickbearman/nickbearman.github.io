 **Using R as a GIS** shows you how the R programming language can transform your GIS journey, empowering you to create stunning maps, analyse spatial data, and unlock advanced geospatial insights–no prior experience needed! <br /> <br /> This book shows you how to use R as a GIS, enabling you to all the spatial analysis you want to, with the reproducibility and benefits of working with a scripting language. <br /> <br /> This book is designed for people who are new to R, or even new to scripting and programming. No prior knowledge is needed! Ideally, you will know a little bit of GIS already, and maybe have opened QGIS or ArcGIS. However don't worry if you haven't, we will cover the key GIS terminology that you need to know.

## Reviews

**Dr Peter Mooney, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Maynooth University**

- Using R as a GIS by Dr Nick Bearman is a very timely book providing an accessible introduction to both GIS and R and how readers can develop their skills to use a script-based approach to GIS.
- The author brings a wealth of experience in the practical application, analysis, and research of GIS coupled with teaching and mentoring experience in R and GIS over many years. This is very evident in the way the book is structured and how the learning outcomes are delivered from start to finish.
- I found the book easy to read and logically split into five parts. Nick's writing style is accessible and flows very well while moving at a pace that is very similar to a tutorial style or workshop learning experience.  This enhances the book’s potential as a learning tool for a wide variety of learners.
- Using R as a GIS has the potential to enhance the learning experience of many students by avoiding unnecessary jargon and theory and focusing on a practical outcomes-based style of teaching. Well done Nick on a fine piece of work.

**Joseph Kempf, Geospatial Jobs**

- Using R as a GIS by Dr. Nick Bearman is a fantastic introduction to using R for geospatial work. 
- The book is designed covers a wide range of topics, focusing on core GIS concepts and practical tools for working with spatial data.
- It walks readers through everything from cartography and raster data manipulation to creating interactive maps.
- It also introduces essential programming skills—like loops and functions—and practical tips for file management, version control with GitHub, and finding spatial data. 
- Whether you’re just starting out or looking to expand your geospatial skills, this book provides a solid foundation for making the most of R in GIS.

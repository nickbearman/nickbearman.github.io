 **Using R as a GIS** shows you how the R programming language can transform your GIS journey, empowering you to create stunning maps, analyse spatial data, and unlock advanced geospatial insights–no prior experience needed! <br /> <br /> This book shows you how to use R as a GIS, enabling you to all the spatial analysis you want to, with the reproducibility and benefits of working with a scripting language. <br /> <br /> This book is designed for people who are new to R, or even new to scripting and programming. No prior knowledge is needed! Ideally, you will know a little bit of GIS already, and maybe have opened QGIS or ArcGIS. However don't worry if you haven't, we will cover the key GIS terminology that you need to know.

## Reviews

**Dr Peter Mooney, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Maynooth University**

- "Using R as a GIS by Dr Nick Bearman is a very timely book providing an accessible introduction to both GIS and R and how readers can develop their skills to use a script-based approach to GIS." 
- "The author brings a wealth of experience in the practical application, analysis, and research of GIS coupled with teaching and mentoring experience in R and GIS over many years. This is very evident in the way the book is structured and how the learning outcomes are delivered from start to finish."
- "I found the book easy to read and logically split into five parts. Nick's writing style is accessible and flows very well while moving at a pace that is very similar to a tutorial style or workshop learning experience.  This enhances the book’s potential as a learning tool for a wide variety of learners."
- "Using R as a GIS has the potential to enhance the learning experience of many students by avoiding unnecessary jargon and theory and focusing on a practical outcomes-based style of teaching. Well done Nick on a fine piece of work."

<p>I’ve just returned from a fantastic 2 days in Leeds for FOSS4G:UK 2025. FOSS4G is an amazing group, and I am so proud to be part of the fantastic team that ran FOSS4G:UK 2025 Leeds on 1st and 2nd October 2025. We were in the great venue <a href="https://horizonleeds.co.uk/">Horizon Leeds</a>, with two days of workshops and talks.</p>

</div>
<p>I always love the fact that for many of these conferences you can have the choice of going to talks or going to workshops for the whole two days. People have so many things they want to share, we can provide so much content! One workshop was enough for me, and I learnt a great deal about <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-uk-2025/talk/9HHT8Q/">QGIS Model Builder from Ant Scott</a> - a great way of automating procedures if you don’t want to learn how to code. <em>Of course, if you do want to learn to code, I would recommend <a href="https://nickbearman.com/training-courses">R</a>!</em></p>
<p>There is also the range of content - some highly technical talks, for example the one on Mesh datasets, which I didn’t catch myself, but I heard was brain melting! <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-uk-2025/talk/QKV9ZY/">All Datasets are Meshes: Towards a new Ontology for 3D GIS</a> - to some fascinating insights on running a commercial business using open source software from both <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-uk-2025/talk/ZGEVTN/">Alex Wrottesley at Idox Geospatial</a> and <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-uk-2025/talk/DZVYFH/">Mike Saunt from Astun</a> and some great hints and tips including <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-uk-2025/talk/3WBLMF/">Tom Armitage on QGIS Blend Modes</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="keynote-presentations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="keynote-presentations">Keynote presentations</h2>
<p>We had three fantastic keynotes: first up was <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-uk-2025/talk/EQNXHG/">Kathryn Berger, Lead Data Scientist from UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT)</a>. She talked about how she first came across GIS through an initiative providing free Landsat images for schools in New Hampshire, USA in the 1990s (at this point, access to Landsat images was chargable). These formed part of a project getting school children (including her) out into nature to measure trees, calculate biomass and correlate this with the Landsat images. It lit her excitement for GIS and she has been working with GIS ever since.</p>
<p>She also provided a great example of some of the limitations of AI. One fascinating application of AI is to digitise building footprints - a very tedious job to do by hand, which would be great if we could automate it and speed it up. In some areas this works very well, but in other areas it does not.</p>

<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10584113">Auditing Geospatial Datasets for Biases: Using Global Building Datasets for Disaster Risk Management</a></p>
<p>In the image above, on the left the buildings highlighted with a white outline have been digitised by the local population. On the right, the same buildings have been digitised by AI. You can spot the missing buildings in the middle easily - these types of building were clearly not considered to be buildings by this AI. However, if we then use this data to calculate how many vaccinations an area might need, how much aid might be needed, how much support might be needed after a natural disaster, then if we use the AI (yellow) version, quite a lot of people are going short!</p>
<p>If you are interested how many buildings might be missing, <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude.ai</a> says: “There appear to be approximately 60-70 buildings highlighted in white. There appear to be approximately 80-100 buildings highlighted in yellow.” So a potential difference of ~30%-40%. <em><a href="https://claude.ai/share/f4957014-117e-4501-b1f1-d25973614df0">Source</a></em></p>
<p>She also mentioned the <a href="https://civicus.org/index.php/media-resources/news/interviews/6534-ai-the-biggest-challenges-are-the-biases-and-lack-of-transparency-of-algorithms">HOT (Humantarian OpenStreetMap Team) approach to AI</a> which is a great one to use:</p>
<p>The problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most current AI models are closed, unclear how and on what data the model was trained (most often with built in biases)</li>
</ul>
<p>Their solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tackle biases by localising models, (don’t use a general model that works everywhere)</li>
<li>Use fully open-source AI models for transparency (so it’s clear how AI systems are trained and who is training them)</li>
<li>Use local knowledge, human-in-the-loop, to validate and provide feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>Our second keynote was <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-uk-2025/talk/BJF3RX/">Mariam Crichton</a> who is a big fan of thinking about how our work connects to the world as a whole. She said ‘all data is global data’ and was keen for us to know, that even if we are working in a very country or local focused way, our work is part of something much bigger - and can have some much bigger impacts.</p>
<p>She also highlighted some really interesting priorities for open data from her experience in the sustainability market, and other highly regulated fields - they are not what you might expect:</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-10-foss4guk-2025-leeds/sustainability-market.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-uk-2025/talk/WXV9JW/">Alasdair Rae</a> talked about getting to the point and what drives us as geospatial professionals. Open source has many many strengths - including collaboration. He had a whole slide on this (which now I can’t find a picture of!) but his key message was that collaboration is key to success and we need to remember this. He also had this gem:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thank-you---and-the-future">Thank you :-) and the future…</h2>
<p>I volunteered to be on the Local Organising Committee (LOC) and the conference would not have happened without the rest of the committee - thank you so much to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dennis-bauszus-45b55760_foss4guk-foss4g-foss4g2027-activity-7379618896456134656-7a5W?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAASXC6wBRv0w74LkW4jBxSVP-9ldgbYpLRk">Dennis</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antscott_foss4guk-osgeouk-activity-7379954237247483904-arg5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAASXC6wBRv0w74LkW4jBxSVP-9ldgbYpLRk">Ant</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jsonsingh_foss4guk-gis-foss4g-ugcPost-7380520354793885696-T0qE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAASXC6wBRv0w74LkW4jBxSVP-9ldgbYpLRk">Json</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/clairelouisebirnie_foss4guk-foss4g-ugcPost-7379804246151438336-1TdQ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAASXC6wBRv0w74LkW4jBxSVP-9ldgbYpLRk">Claire</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/weiming-huang-bb0073152/">Weiming</a>. I’d also like to say a special thank you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-travis-6a609321/">Matt</a>, who did a lot of work as Treasurer behind the scenes getting money from sponsors, but couldn’t be there for the event!</p>
<p>I would also not hesitate to recommend the venue, <a href="https://horizonleeds.co.uk/">Horizon Leeds</a>. It is a lovely space, and with 180 people we filled it nicely. There were also no queues for coffee or lunch, which I think is a first for me! Coffee (&amp; tea) were available on demand from two stations any time, and lunch was a grab and go ‘bento box’ split over two stations, which meant no queues either. We also had a lovely selection of 4 different lunches.</p>
<p>Lastly, we also had a discussion on the potential of the UK to bid for (and hopefully host) the FOSS4G International conference, most likely in 2027 in Bristol. Watch this space for details, and if you want to help out, join the OSGeo:UK mailing list for details.</p>
<p>All three keynotes, and all the talks in Create 1 and Create 2 were videoed (including the <a href="https://uk.osgeo.org/agm/agm2025.html">AGM</a> which was extra fun with no slides!) so they will be on our YouTube channel in a month or two - watch our social media for details.</p>

  <title>RGS AIC 2025 in Birmingham</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-09-rgs-conference/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It was great to be able to attend a couple of days of the <a href="https://www.rgs.org/research/annual-international-conference">RGS-IBG Annual International Conference</a> at the University of Birmingham last week. The RGS conference is an annual gathering of around 2000 geographers, with presentations covering the full range of geography - from AI, GIS analysis, quantitative methods, transport geography, animal research, development studies, inclusive research practice, and many many others.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-09-rgs-conference/welcome.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I attended a number of sessions sponsored by the <a href="https://giscience-rgs.github.io/">GIScience Research Group</a> and the <a href="https://qmrg.github.io/">Quantitative Methods Research Group</a>.</p>
<p>The first one of these was focused on post-graduate researchers (PGRs), with 5 PGRs presenting their research. It was fascinating to hear about the range of topics they were working on, including machine learning based classification of social media data, exploring street crime using crowd sourced street view imagery, and the relationship between housing development and public transportation provision in the UK. The session wrapped up with discussions on the impacts of spatial structure of cities on potential spread of infectious diseases, and a great example from Germany looking at measuring urban growth.</p>
<p>The QMRG (Quantitative Methods Research Group) held their first annual lecture, in conjunction with The Geographical Journal. One of the main aims of this lecture series is to engage more with the theoretical aspects of the issues we face. Quantitative Methods, and GIS more generally, can often be quite data and stats heavy, but we need to remember how this fits into the wider setting of geography.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-09-rgs-conference/listening.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The first lecture was Mapping Uneven Ambience by Caitlin Robinson, who took us on a fascinating journey through her most recent project looking at the ambient environment.</p>
<p>This was the first stage of a larger project, and was focused on a range of factors around peoples lived experience, including air quality, noise and housing infrastructure. Currently she has explored this through a number of different data sets, including EPC (Energy Performance Certificates) providing information on heating in the home and ventilation, external air quality data from DEFRA and IMD data.</p>
<p>One key dataset that was missing was data on indoor air quality - which is vitally important for this type of work, as it is estimated that in the global north, people spend 80-90% of their time indoors. One of the questions at the end of the presentation provided a potentially useful data source for this, which is often the case at conferences!</p>
<p>The next stage will start looking at the interrelations between the different factors - for example indoor air quality and heating type - which will certainly be interesting to see as the vulnerabilities are often cumulative - exposure to indoor air pollution, combined with poor heating in the winter, will most likely lead to a much poorer outcome than either issue alone.</p>
<p>On the Thursday morning, I attended two sessions on Artificial Intelligence in GIScience and Quantitative Geography, where there were a fascinating range of presentations, looking at the space embedded in census data, embedding geography into vision language models and a wide range of other papers.</p>
<p>At Thursday lunchtime I chaired the ‘Best of GISRUK’ session, which showcased the three best papers from this year’s <a href="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-3-gisruk/">GISRUK conference in Bristol</a>. It was a joint session from GISRUK, and the GIScience Research Group (where I am a committee member). The aim of this session was to show what GIS can do to a wider audience. The majority of people attending the RGS Conference do not use GIS on a regular basis, and may never have used it before. The idea of this session is to get these people to come along and get them excited about GIS, what it can do and hopefully spark some thoughts about how it might be useful in their research. We had a great turn out of 42 people in the session and I hope to see some of them using GIS in the future!</p>

  <title>Becoming a Dad</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>This blog post isn’t about GIS, mapping, conferences or travel, so feel free to skip it if you want. However, if you’re interested in my experiences of becoming a Dad, read on. Be warned - it is quite a long post (~3000 words, ~6 pages) and contains details about birth, C-sections and medical treatment.</em></p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>This is the story of bringing our son, Baby Bearman, into the world.</p>
<p><em>I’m calling him Baby Bearman here a) because we don’t have a name for him yet (you have 6 weeks after birth to decide, and we have been rather preoccupied recently!) and b) I don’t want this blog post to be the first thing that comes up when people search for his name!</em></p>
<p>Baby Bearman was due on Wed 25th June 2025, but ended up arriving early on Sun 8th June 2025, 2 and a half weeks early (at 37 weeks 4 days). All of us (Baby, Mum and Dad) are now doing well, although it has been quite a struggle at times.</p>
<section id="tue-3rd-june" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tue-3rd-june">Tue 3rd June</h3>
<p>We start our journey at our antenatal appointment on Tue 3rd June, my wife, Louise’s blood pressure was borderline high. The reading was just under the threshold for them to worry about, so the midwife said to keep an eye on it and phone if we have questions.</p>
</section>
<section id="sun-8th-june-10am" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sun-8th-june-10am">Sun 8th June ~10am</h3>
<p>On Sunday, Louise’s blood pressure was still a little high, so we phoned up the maternity advice line at 10am and they advised us to come in. Things started speeding up then, and happened very quickly, compared to the last 37 weeks /8 months!</p>
<p>We came in, and Louise had a blood pressure series done, where her blood pressure was taken every 5 minutes for half an hour. It was a bit high, so they sent blood and urine off for additional tests, and monitored the baby for an hour. The consultant explained a bit about pre-eclampsia, while Louise’s blood pressure was high, her urine dip test for protein was negative. You need to have both for pre-eclampsia to be diagnosed. To preempt further development of pre-eclampsia, the consultant recommended we consider early delivery of the baby. Usually they would wait until 41 weeks to induce (if the birth wasn’t spontaneous), but he recommended we induce at 39 weeks (18th June). Louise was given medication to reduce her blood pressure and we were booked for a followup appointment on the next day.</p>
</section>
<section id="sun-8th-june-4pm" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sun-8th-june-4pm">Sun 8th June ~4pm</h3>
<p>On the way home, Louise developed a headache and took paracetamol. She continued to feel worse, and her headache got worse, so we phoned up (4:44pm). They advised us to come back in. She was feeling sick and threw up in the car. We got to Dorchester, and to the maternity unit. A nurse coming off shift took one look at her and took us straight in. We were in a shared ward and they assessed her. She was also suffering from edema (swelling) during pregnancy, but it had suddenly increased by now. Her blood pressure was higher. They tried to get an IV in but it was quite tricky because the pre-eclampsia makes the blood vessels smaller, compounded by the fact she had thrown up, so didn’t have much liquid left in her. She was given pills to reduce blood pressure but just threw them up again. She was also suffering photophobia - aversion to light - all the way from home into Dorchester, which is another symptom of pre-eclampsia. There were five people around Louise at this point, so it was getting rather crowded. We were moved to a private room. There they managed to get an IV in, done by an anesthesiologist with an ultrasound machine.</p>
<p><em>I would later discover that if the midwife had trouble getting an IV in, or taking blood, they would ask a consultant. If the consultant couldn’t do it, then the anesthesiologist would try. If they had trouble, they would use an ultrasound machine to see the blood vessels to help them gain access. At this point, Louise needed an anesthesiologist and an ultrasound machine!</em></p>
<p>They gave her IV paracetamol for her headache (which she would later describe as a migraine) and IV medications to lower her blood pressure. The consultant explained that the blood pressure was a result of the pre-eclampsia, and we later discovered that the pre-eclampsia had come on very very quickly. He said that Louise needed the placenta removed, and therefore needed to give birth. For this she needed an emergency C-section (caesarean section) as soon as possible. Louise’s consent was needed, and the consultant managed to explain the options in a way she could understand in the state she was in. Her blood pressure was still quite high at this point (one reading was 164/111, which is very high). The baby was being monitored throughout all of this, and he was fine. For the C-section operation, her blood pressure had to be under control. Therefore they put her on blood pressure medication via IV, and monitored her from about 7pm to about 10pm.</p>
</section>
<section id="sun-8th-june-10pm" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sun-8th-june-10pm">Sun 8th June ~10pm</h3>
<p>By about 10pm, Louise’s blood pressure was under control and we were taken in for the C-section. I had to change into scrubs, and was allowed to be in the theatre with her. There must have been at least 10 people in the room and it was quite a busy experience. We had a great anesthesiologist, who talked Louise and myself through the whole process. Louise chose a spinal tap for pain management; less severe than a general anesthetic and so Louise could be conscious throughout the whole procedure. Her blood pressure was a little problematic, and there were a couple of times where she was quite out of it. Everything went well though and Baby Bearman was born at 22:46.</p>
<p>After they had taken the baby out, I was allowed to take some photos, and also cut the umbilical cord. It was quite a surreal experience and I was privileged to be a part of it.</p>
<p>We had about half an hour in recovery after the C-section. Louise recovered very quickly with the major pre-eclampsia symptoms disappearing as soon as the placenta was removed. We were then transferred to a room, with mum and baby having hourly checks. We had a midwife with us all the time, with a second mid wife there most of the time until 8am.</p>
</section>
<section id="mon-9th-june" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mon-9th-june">Mon 9th June</h3>
<p>We stayed in the same room for most of the rest of the day. They still took hourly observations, but in general we were left to sleep. The baby slept a bit, but a lot of the time he wanted to be held, and when you are holding a baby you can’t sleep, so we didn’t get much sleep that day or Monday night. Louise was on fluid restriction, so limited to drinking 75ml per hour.</p>
<p>Monday day and evening progressed in a bit of haze. I did go and get some food from the hospital restaurant: a jacket potato at lunch time, which went down well, and some very spicy sweet and sour for dinner, which I had trouble eating. Louise had food brought to her (as the patient) which she demolished very effectively.</p>
<p>At 6:30pm, we were moved to room 4, where we would be for the rest of our stay. Monday night was really hard for both of us, as the baby wanted a lot of cuddles and wasn’t keen on being put down. I did have a bed, so when Louise had the baby I could lie down, but found it very hard to sleep as I was too stressed.</p>
</section>
<section id="tue-10th-june" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tue-10th-june">Tue 10th June</h3>
<p>On Tuesday morning I went to get cereal in the day room. I sat there to eat it to have a bit of time out of our room, and I was completely overwhelmed. I sat there and cried. I had trouble processing what had happened, and looking back on it now, I was so sleep deprived (no sleep on Sunday night and not much on Monday night) I couldn’t process anything.</p>
<p>Another visitor came over and asked if I was OK. I said both mum and baby were OK (I didn’t realise at this point how serious things had been for Louise or the baby). She said she thought someone had died, based on how I was.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday morning, one of the midwives visited and we talked a bit. This was mostly how Louise was getting on and how the baby was. Nobody explicitly asked me how I was doing. However, I knew enough about my mental health to realise that I was struggling and that I needed to say something, and this midwife looked like the person to say it to. I said to her I was struggling with everything. She listened and said we could talk. We had a good talk, and I tried to explain how I felt. It was at this point I realised I hadn’t slept for 48 hours+, which contributed to how I was feeling. The midwife explained about how we had to support each other and tag-team with the baby, i.e.&nbsp;I do some feeding and cuddling while Louise rests, and Louise does feeding and cuddling while I rest. She also let us know that it is often the case that the second night after birth (i.e.&nbsp;last night, Monday night for us) was the worst.</p>
<p>Given that we were likely to be in the hospital a bit longer, I was encouraged to go home for a bit of a break. Due to the fact the pre-eclampsia had come on so quickly, and we came in two and half weeks earlier than planned, I had brought no spare clothes with me. We already had stuff packed for the baby (nappies, wipes, etc.) and a couple of bits for Louise (maternity top, change of underwear) but I didn’t have anything. When we left on Sunday I did have the presence of mind to throw some snacks and drinks in a bag which were a life saver.</p>
<p>I went to Sainsbury’s to pick up some muslin and socks for the baby and I had a lovely call from my brother in law, Peter (Louise’s brother). He knew that I was an only child, and he said he knew people would be seeing how Louise and the baby were doing, but he wanted to ask how I was doing. I was touched by this and very grateful for the phone call.</p>
<p><em>While I was driving home, I had a very deep and meaningful thought. Of course, it seemed deep and meaningful at the time, but I was lacking in sleep, so it could be complete rubbish! I thought that whilst my world has completely changed with the birth of my son, the rest of the world hasn’t changed at all. Everything is exactly the same as it was before he was born. From globally crucial things like the wars in Russia/Ukraine and Israel and climate change, to the mundane and everyday, like the oddly designed set of traffic lights by Asda in Weymouth which you have to be very careful driving through. Since then everything has sunk in a bit more, so I am more used to him being here, and everything seems less “different”.</em></p>
<p>Tuesday night in hospital was better. We planned a bit and managed to tag-team, with me doing some feeds while Louise rested and Louise doing some feeds while I rested. We both got a bit of rest, although looking back now, we both still slept badly in the hospital, but it was so much better than the night before by comparison! I had jacket potato for dinner that evening.</p>
<p>Of course, Louise was in quite a lot of pain from the C-section. She had been given regular paracetamol, and at this point two doses of ibuprofen. One midwife on Tuesday evening refused to give Louise ibuprofen, despite her having it previously. The midwife said it wasn’t written on her chart, so she couldn’t have it; despite Louise’s protests that she’d had it twice already! She gave Louise dihydrochloride instead which was supposed to be a more powerful painkiller, but it didn’t make much impact on Louise’s pain. In fact the pain got worse, because she didn’t get the ibuprofen. Later on, Louise said this issue with the pain medication set back her recovery.</p>
<p><em>After the shift change, a new midwife came on and gave Louise ibuprofen when she asked for it, which helped with her pain. Apparently the ibuprofen had actually been written on Louise’s chart, but in “a funny place”. We never established what that meant.</em></p>
<p>Later on the same evening Louise was given a dose of Nifedipine, medicine to manage her high blood pressure. Her blood pressure had been monitored 4 hourly and was still high, an after effect of the pre-eclampsia. In the early hours of the morning, very suddenly Louise had heart palpitations and a very fast heart rate. It was quite scary for her. She used the call button, but by the time someone had come the palpitations had eased a bit. A cardiac nurse did come in and run an ECG test to check Louise’s heart, and everything looked fine. She didn’t have the palpitations again. Louise had been prescribed Nifedipine every twelve hours after the C-section - 9am and 9pm, 20mg. When 9am came around, the Nifedipine pills looked different to the ones she’d had at 9pm the previous night. At 9am she had two small pink pills which we were told was 20mg; at 9pm night before she’d had two different pills (maybe a different brand), which she was told was 2 x 10mg but we suspect were 2 x 20mg pills. This probably caused the heart palpitations. This was rather worrying and we have tried to keep a close eye on the pills since. This is quite tricky in hospitals, particularly when sleep deprived and when the pills are delivered in a small paper cup, it’s hard to know what they are. Also when they are delivered with a not great bedside manner, this makes it harder to ask and check what you are being given.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wed-11th-june">Wed 11th June</h2>
<p>Louise had been very unwell with the pre-clampasia and was getting better having given birth, and with our sleep deprived states it was hard to process our emotions, so we were struggling a bit. Later on that morning, we had a visit from the feeding team, and Baby was weighed. He’d lost 12.8% from his birth weight.</p>
<p><em>It’s usual for babies to lose some weight after giving birth - going from a nice warm, dark womb where food is provided on demand through an umbilical cord, to a bright, (relatively) cold, dry world, where you actually have to suckle and swallow to get food is quite a shock to the system! Particularly if you are born at only 37 weeks and 4 days, so ~2.5 weeks early (although babies are fully developed at 37 weeks). </em></p>
<p>The 12.8% loss is more than the typical 10% loss that is normal, so they were a bit worried about his weight and feeding. The feeding team talked to us about his feeding. He was happy going on Louise’s breast, but wasn’t suckling so hadn’t really taken on any milk since birth. They put us on a feeding plan, with a specific amount of milk (50ml) to give him every 3 hours. Louise was producing milk, so they introduced us to a breast pump, which we used, and then gave to Baby in a bottle. We then topped it up to 50ml with formula, every 3 hours. I was shown the ropes for sterilising the kit and bottles, and given the task of fetching, cleaning and sterilising the kit for every feed. Louise said that I spent a lot of time looking after the baby on Wednesday, giving her time to sleep and recover.</p>
<p>Louise’s parents visited today and arrived early afternoon. It was lovely to see them, and they stayed until around 5pm. We had dinner down in the hospital restaurant - jacket potato again for me and then they headed off. I slowly was feeling better and the visit made a nice change from the hospital routine.</p>
<p><em>It is amazing how frequently the advice around birth and newborns changes. One of our midwives, who was a third year student midwife, said that something she had learnt in her first year of study had now changed, with a better technique for feeding directly after birth. The advice changes frequently, and it even changed while we were in hospital! Louise had her C-section dressing checked, and removed this evening. Later on, the same midwife came back and said the advice for C-section dressings had changed, and now they were left on for five days rather than three, as this had been shown to reduce infection, so they replaced Louise’s dressing.</em></p>
<p>By Wednesday evening, everything was getting better and we were feeling more on top of things. We had some great advice from one of the midwives that evening about bottle feeding and successfully burping a baby - apparently burping is something they actually have to learn how to do!</p>
<p>The feeding plan the baby was on was going well, and Louise was expressing milk well. I was getting used to sterilising the equipment each time, and making the 55 metre walk, each way, twice every three hours (a total of 1.76 km every 24 hours), to get the bottles for Louise to express, and then return them and to wash and sterilise them. Louise was still trying to breast feed but having very limited success.</p>
<p>Later on that evening I had woken up for the ~1am feed and wasn’t feeling particularly with it. We needed the steriliser and bottles for Louise to express and I wasn’t feeling up to the long walk, so we asked one of the staff to get it for us, which they were very happy to do. She returned with the sterilising kit, but not the bottles. We asked her whether the bottles were there and she swore blind that they were not there. She got us some new bottles so Louise could do the expressing. The following feed I was more with it, so I went and checked and discovered the bottles were there, exactly where I said they were!</p>
</section>
<section id="thu-12th-june" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thu-12th-june">Thu 12th June</h2>
<p>On Wednesday I had run around doing lots of things, and I think I had probably over done it: I wasn’t feeling that great. I broke down and cried again. I hadn’t eaten much and I think my brain had processed a bit more of what had happened and was struggling with it. We did have some good news that we were likely to be discharged on Thursday!</p>
<p>One of the midwives came to go through the discharge process, and in the check in, Louise said to her that I had been struggling. She had a chat with me, and asked whether I was looking after myself and whether I’d been eating enough. Thinking about it, I’d not really been eating enough since Sunday. Sunday night I had nothing, being preoccupied with the C-section (although I had had a main meal in the middle of the day). Monday I had toast for breakfast, jacket potato for lunch and a bit of sweet and sour pork for dinner. Tuesday I had cereal for breakfast, risotto for lunch (when I went home to pick up stuff) and jacket potato for dinner. Wednesday was toast for breakfast, jacket potato for lunch and jacket potato again for dinner. So I had been eating much less than normal for me. Discovering this, she essentially kicked me out of the room to go and get some lunch while she went through feeding and baby checks with Louise, which would take a while. I am eternally grateful for this and I took the opportunity to go to a nearby pub and have a decent burger and chips. I felt much better after this and was rather amazed that I had ended up in this position - missing out meals and not eating enough is not at all normal for me.</p>
<p>Louise’s parents arrived about 3pm, while we were getting sorted for discharge. I made various trips back to the car with stuff, and also managed to fit the child seat. We had had the child seat for a little while, but I hadn’t actually fitted it yet as I was planning on having 3 more weeks to work out how to fit it, before Baby was born!</p>
<p>We got out of the hospital about 5pm, and by pure coincidence saw the anesthesiologist from Louise’s C-section. She was thrilled to see us, and to see us leaving - Louise had been quite poorly because of the pre-eclampsia when she last saw us, so she said it was such a massive difference to see her looking so much better.</p>
<p>Over our 4 nights and 5 days in the hospital, we had some great care and met some fantastic staff - I can’t thank them enough for their time, patience and skill in looking after us. However, it was also clear they were massively overworked, short staffed and a couple of them were mediocre or even poor. The NHS is a fantastic institution with some great staff, but it also has some major issues. We can’t wave a magic wand and solve these issues but we need to find solutions that work, whilst keeping all of the fantastic elements that are in it.</p>

  <title>GISRUK 2025 in Bristol</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-3-gisruk/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Last week I was fortunate to be able to attend GISRUK 2025, in Bristol, UK. I am a regular at the GISRUK conference series and it is always fascinating to see the latest work in GIS in the UK.</p>
<p>This year it was hosted by University of Bristol, which gave me an opportunity to see a little of Bristol as well. I had a lovely walk up Cabot Tower, Brandon Hill, with some spectacular views of the city, it being the highest point in Bristol.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-3-gisruk/bristol.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The keynote presentations are always very good at GISRUK, and this year we had three fascinating ones. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/geography-sustainable-development/people/ud2">Urska Demsar</a> talked about her work linking animal movement and human mobility, which is a great example of two areas that use similar techniques but have completely different terminology, and her work to create a new framework to link these two areas will create gains in both fields by the sharing of techniques.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Michele-Acuto-e478f1f9-3934-4a83-91e6-4707cb949ba7/">Michele Acuto</a> gave a fascinating insight into Data after Dark: Shedding (Geospatial) Light onto the Night-time Economy. It is a world who we can easily forget, those who work at night. About 26% of UK employed people work at night, and often they are ignore from our analysis of cities. Transport networks can provide some insights, with many global cities transport networks non-existent from ~2am - ~5am. Transaction data can provide an interesting insight into this, but about 25% of night-time activity doesn’t involve a financial transaction, so there are large segments of this activity that are difficult to capture in data. Michele encouraged us go out at night and think about who we see - particularly those who are working.</p>
<p><a href="https://le.ac.uk/people/stef-de-sabbata">Stef De Sabbata</a> gave the final keynote titled <a href="https://sdesabbata.github.io/slides/gisruk-2025.html">What is geo/spatial about (geo)ai?</a> Here she talked about going back to the basics of AI and thinking about what is the prior knowledge (“priors”) that AI has about geospatial data. There appear to be more than we might initially think, for example, the concept of ‘cities’ appears to be present, as well as some concept of latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>This year I was also presenting a paper, <a href="../../writing-presentations.html">Location-allocation and public transit: An update on UCL student teacher placements</a>, which was an update on the location allocation work I have been doing with spopt and UCL IOE. It was great to share some of the experiences and challenges of working in such a diverse team, as well as sharing the benefits the tool would bring to the Placements team in IOE. See <a href="../../writing-presentations.html">Writing &amp; Presentations</a> for links to the paper and the slides.</p>
<p>Finally it was a great opportunity to network and link up with new and existing colleagues and catch up on the latest developments.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-3-gisruk/dinner.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I also had two other roles during the conference. Firstly, I, along with Jonny Huck, was judging entries for the <a href="https://gisruk.github.io/osgeo/">GISRUK &amp; OSGeo:UK GoFundGeo Award</a>, a grant to help the recipient to make spatial analysis code easily adoptable by others through the provision of an open source code repository, tool or plugin. We are very happy to confirm that the GoFundGeo winner is Melissa Barrientos Triñanes, with her work on <a href="">Utilising open data to enhance park safety for women and girls in Bradford: A spatial analysis approach.</a>. We liked this as a nice clear project with clearly identifiable outputs that could be useful to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Secondly, a new initiative this year is that the GIScRG (GISc Research Group) of the RGS-IBG is putting on a session ‘Best of GISRUK’ at the RGS Annual International Conference, which this year is at University of Birmingham from Tue 26 to Fri 29 Aug.&nbsp;We are inviting all of the prize winners to present their work in our session, in order to get more people outside GIS to hear about how GIS can be useful. Congratulations to all of the winners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Poster - Sam Denney - <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15183848">School-level factors influencing NEET outcomes in England</a></li>
<li>Best Paper by ECR - Jessica Hepburn - <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15228683">Parks, Place and Equality: Mapping access to different park typology in Britian’s 20-minute neighbourhood</a></li>
<li>Best Paper - Adam Dennett - GIS vs.&nbsp;The City Council: Data analytics, collective intelligence and policy dust-ups</li>
<li>Best Paper in Spatial Analysis - Chris Larkin - <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15231749">Integrating Low Traffic Neighbourhoods into UK Cycle Network Planning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations to all the winners and we hope to see you at the RGS conference in Birmingham.</p>

  <title>The Open Science Retreat, Batenberg, Switzerland: collaboation, connection and snow!</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-2-open-science-retreat/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>For four days in April I was lucky enough to be able to attend the Open Science Retreat, in Batenberg, Switzerland. The Open Science Retreat (OSR) is a chance for anyone interested in and passionate about Open Science to get together, brain storm ideas and spend time working on projects related to this. It is run by the <a href="https://digital-research.academy/">Digital Research Academy</a>, with a focus on discussion and networking as well as getting some interesting outputs. “A week full of scientific discussions and reflections, getting work done, making new friends and resetting.” I have already written another blog post about travelling there <a href="../2025-04-1-travel-to-interlaken/">by train</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-2-open-science-retreat/the-view.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The event works on an unconference format, with topic groups submitted a week or so before the event. We then had a chance to hear from the proposers about each of the topics, and talk with other people interested in the topic. This means there’s a bit of evolution of the topics, with the topics revised based on who is attending and what they want to do. Written down, this does sound sightly random, but it does work in practice. Within about 30 min of discussions, we had formed then 6 topic groups that would run throughout the remainder of the Retreat.</p>
<p>Alongside the topic groups, which ran for 3 mornings, there were a variety of short sessions (30min - 1hr) and workshops (2hr) as well as a focus on well being and recovery from what often is a busy academic schedule. In the spectacular setting of Batenburg, Switzerland, I made the most of the location and spent a reasonable amount of time outside. There was an organised walk around the Swiss mountains, and trips out to see local sights. We also had optional social events in the evening, with opportunities for silent disco, board games and networking.</p>

</div>
<p>I opted to take part in the ‘Even More Open’ group, which was a combination of topics focused about discover-ability and usability of Open Science tools including Quick and Easy Wins for Open Science and discussion around the use of AI. Our group was larger than typical for these groups (9 people) so after some initial discussions we split into one more theoretical group and one more practical group. I was working with more-practical group on a new tool to help discover existing Open Science tools, on the principle that while there are many many tools out there, it can be hard to find the right tool for the job. This <a href="https://www.advansci-research.com/resourcelist">tool</a> is currently hosted on AdvancdSci Research Solutions and allows you to select tools for specific points in the research life cycle, subject area, level of complexity and a number of other options:</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-2-open-science-retreat/resource-list.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>As a part of the OSR, the aim was to make outputs available at the end of the week, in an open form (of course!). We have shared our output on Research Equals, a new platform for me, but a way of sharing outputs with a DOI. For us, this included a summary report with links to our tool and other outputs and slide from the wrap up sessions: <a href="https://doi.org/10.53962/znvv-1p7c">DOI: 10.53962/znvv-1p7c</a></p>
<p>There is so much potential with open science it is sometimes hard to pin down exactly what to do or how to do it. A number of groups addressed this is a number of different ways, including discussions about how to reward participation in Open Science, dealing with burnout and roles as an activist and a short session on calendar management. Check out all the available outputs on <a href="https://www.researchequals.com/collections/k86g-wf">Research Equals</a>.</p>
<p>This was not my typical GIS conference, and it was great to meet with a different group outside GIS! I did get a chance to help a group make a map. The Open Science activists were keen to create <a href="https://nickbearman.github.io/open-science-activism-map/">a map of activists</a> which they could update and edit without relying on third parties (organisations or people). I adapted <a href="https://micheletobias.github.io/traveling-gis-chat-book/">The Fellowship of the Traveling #GISChat Book</a> which is a Leaflet map based in a website with a bit of R coding to geocode locations and convert the CSV data into GeoJSON. It is currently a work in progress but it was an exciting project to be involved in.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-2-open-science-retreat/open-science-activism-map.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I am a bit fan of making GIS more accessible to anyone who wants to do mapping* and the map I developed for the activist group could easily be adapted for other users. I hope to finish off the automation elements (I need to work out GitHub actions) and potentially package it up as an easy to use tool for anyone else doing mapping.</p>
<p>*I was reminded about the variation in terminology that we have with different groups. The activist group wanted a geographic map of people, but this was not understood by everyone - often the term ‘map’ or ‘mapping’ is used in a non-spatial sense looking at relationships between different members or a group or elements - e.g.&nbsp;how people relate to each other. The group knew what they wanted and I understood them correctly, but not everyone who saw their message did!</p>
<p>Finally, I discovered how varied the weather in Switzerland at about 1200m elevation can be - while most of the trip was sunny, on the final morning I woke up to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-2-open-science-retreat/snow.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It was a great event, and I would recommend it to anyone who in interested in discussing or doing Open Science. The next retreat is planned to be in the UK, so please do come along! Join the DRA <a href="https://heidiseibold.kit.com/36d99705ec">mailing list</a> to learn about upcoming DRA events!</p>

  <title>Travel to Interlaken for the Open Science Retreat</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-1-travel-to-interlaken/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I had been invited to attend the Open Science Retreat (OSR), in Batenberg, Interlaken, Switzerland and this is my journey. I have posted <a href="">another</a> post about the event itself. When I was looking at travel options, I wanted to at least explore the option of going by train rather than flying. When travelling in Europe I always like to explore the options. Going by train is usually more interesting that flying, sometimes more fun and of course always better for the environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-1-travel-to-interlaken/eurostar.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The OSR started at 4pm on Sun 13th April, and finished 4pm on Thursday 17th April 2025.</p>
<p>Looking at the logistics, going by train from Weymouth (UK) to Interlaken (Switzerland) would mean I had to stay overnight somewhere. There aren’t (yet) any sleeper services that work for this journey unfortunately. The options seemed to be to stay overnight in Paris, or Basel.</p>
<p>I did look at flying. The nearest airport to Interlaken (with a reasonable number of connections) was Zurich, and from there to Interlaken is a approx 2.5 hour train journey. I would also have to travel to London adding another 4 hours (3 hours Weymouth to London Waterloo, 1 hour from London Waterloo to whichever airport I would fly from), plus of course getting to the airport 2-3 hours before the flight.</p>
<p>The flight times, with the last flight leaving Zurich at 5:10pm, also meant that I wouldn’t be able to leave Interlaken until the following day, as we finished at 4pm - I would an extra night in a hotel, which I would need on the train anyway.</p>
<p>The cost was also comparable - flying was a bit cheaper - but there wasn’t much in it. My rough notes were that flying would be ~£150 and the train might be ~£50 - ~£90 more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seat61.com/">Seat61.com</a> is a really useful website for train travel anywhere in the world, and I found it really useful as a planning tool. It also has handy advice on booking tickets which was invaluable.</p>
<p>In the end my journey was:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sat 12th April</p>
<ul>
<li>0803 Weymouth 1120 Waterloo £39.70</li>
<li>1431 London St Pancas 1758 Paris Garde du Nord £94
<ul>
<li><em>Stay overnight Paris</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sun 13th April</p>
<ul>
<li>07:58 Paris Gare de L’Est 14:21 Interlaken West £144.02</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Sun 13th - Thu 17th April Open Science Retreat</em></p></li>
<li><p>Thurs 17th April</p>
<ul>
<li>16:34 Interlaken West 22:15 Paris Gare de L’Est £86.65</li>
<li><em>Stay overnight Paris</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Fri 18th April</p>
<ul>
<li>0902 Paris 1030 London £179
<ul>
<li>1235 Waterloo 1515 Weymouth £27.70</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A total of £571.07 - unfortunately significantly more than my initial estimate, but I was a bit late in booking this, about a month before hand, so make sure you book early!</p>
<p>Once booked, the journey itself went very well. I had the joys of a (planned) rail replacement bus from Southampton to Eastleigh but this all went (more or less) to plan. For the journey, I would also recommend the SBB - Swiss Federal Railways app (below). It was very useful for real time departures and also lists which platform the train is on - very handy when you have a tight connection!</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-04-1-travel-to-interlaken/sbb-app.jpeg" class="img-fluid" style="width:30.0%"></p>
<p>Different attendees at OSR had different priorities and a number did fly from the UK and other places in Europe. It is a difficult balance to consider the time / price / environmental issues of travel choices that this type of event requires. I am happy with the choices I made, but of course they are not for everyone. We did also have participants from Brazil and Nigeria, but I think it would be very tricky for them to get to Switzerland without flying!</p>
<p>I’ve written about <a href="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2022-11-foss4g-2022/">train travel before</a> and I think my experience was similar this time - well worth the little extra money to save quite a significant amount of CO2. The extra time is (for me) now slightly harder to justify - but in this case I don’t think it would have made much difference anyway, with the overnight stay.</p>

  <title>tmap version 4 released!</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-02-tmap-v4/</link>

<p>tmap version 4 has now been released, and is now available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html">CRAN</a>. It has a whole range of new features, which we will explore in this blog post.</p>

<p><strong>If those words above mean nothing to you, a quick recap:</strong> <code>tmap</code> is a library used in R to make maps. I use it in my Introduction to Spatial Data and Using R as a GIS training course so if you have attended one of those, you have already used it. If you are interested in learning more, check out my <a href="https://nickbearman.github.io/training-courses.html">Training Courses</a> or my <a href="https://nickbearman.github.io/training-materials.html">Training Materials</a>.</p>

<p>tmap’s maintainer, Martijn Tennekes, has been working on v4 for a number of years, and has quite a few changes under the hood.</p>
<p>From our point of view (people who are new-ish to R, and/or <code>tmap</code>) the code to make maps has changed slightly. Martijn has put in a lot of ‘helper’ information for people transitioning from v3 to v4, so all your code will still work.</p>
<p>For basic maps, <code>qtm()</code> hasn’t changed at all; although you will notice that the defaults have changed:</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:50%;">
<center>
<strong>tmap v3:</strong> <code>qtm(sthelens, fill="Burglary")</code>
</center>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-02-tmap-v4/qtm-v3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>

<strong>tmap v4:</strong> <code>qtm(sthelens, fill="Burglary")</code>
</center>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-02-tmap-v4/qtm-v4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Similarly, <code>tm_shape</code> and <code>tm_polygons</code> are the same for a basic map, but again the defaults have changed.</p>
<p>However, when you get to doing slightly more advanced things with <code>tm_shape</code>, for example specifying colours, the code has changed slightly:</p>

<p>One specific thing of note is that there is a much wider selection of colour pallets available than the Brewer pallets. As such, we now need to specify <code>brewer.greens</code> rather than just <code>Greens</code>. However we do get a handy note if we forget:</p>

<p>Martijn has designed the library to be backwards compatible, and if you do try using some v3 code with v4, it will still run and create your map, and give you some handy advice:</p>

<p>All of this redesign is in aid of better flexibility. For example, in v3 we were limited to <code>tm_polygons()</code>, <code>tm_lines()</code>, <code>tm_symbols()</code>, and <code>tm_raster()</code> (and their derivatives such as <code>tm_borders()</code> and <code>tm_dots()</code>). But with v4, these are easily extendible - so we can have things like <code>tm_cartogram()</code>, <code>tm_donuts()</code> and so on. Many of these are still in development but it opens up a much wider range of options.</p>
<p>In terms of how we show maps, v3 had <code>plot</code> and <code>view</code> modes, but this new framework makes it possible to add other modes as well.</p>
<p>Equally, tmap is based on <code>sf</code> and <code>stars</code>, but the new framework will make it easier to work with other spatial classes, such as <code>SpatRaster</code> and <code>SpatVector</code> from <code>terra</code>.</p>
<p>A nice overview for those already familiar with tmap was at http://mtennekes.github.io/tmap4/ (originally posted in 2021, now removed 2025). A summary of the changes is on <a href="https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/news/index.html?q=v3#tmap-40">GitHub</a>. The website also had a new range of <a href="https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/">tutorials</a> under <strong>Basics</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> which are in the process of being developed.</p>
<p>The fact the tutorials (and the whole website) are built using <code>pkgdown</code> means that it is very easy to open the relevant page on GitHub and make changes. For example, I added a <a href="https://github.com/r-tmap/tmap/pull/1033">fixed breaks example</a> to the <a href="https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/articles/basics_scales">Basic Scales</a> page.</p>
<p>This also featured at the FOSS4G Code Sprint (Brazil) where Andrés Duhour and I <a href="https://github.com/r-tmap/tmap/pull/980">updated</a> the <a href="https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/articles/versus_ggplot2">ggplot2 comparison article</a>.</p>

  <title>FOSS4G 2024 - Belém, Brazil</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I was very lucky to be able to attend <a href="https://2024.foss4g.org/en/">FOSS4G 2024</a>, in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/15986845">Belém, Brazil</a> on 2nd - 8th December 2024. Belém is a fantastic city, and due to host <a href="https://sdg.iisd.org/events/2025-un-climate-change-conference-unfccc-cop-30/">COP30</a> in November 2025, with lots of construction on going. FOSS4G has a wonderful community and a great variety of talks - have a look at the <a href="https://2024.foss4g.org/en/general-schedule/">agenda</a> to see the different topics under discussion.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>The first two days were workshops, and I attended <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2024-workshop/talk/SQNGBH/">XYZ Cloud MAPPing 101</a> presented by Dennis Bauszus, and <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2024-workshop/talk/YTQJZ7/">Community Drone Mapping</a> by Ivan Buendía Gayton. In some ways I find the workshops the most useful element of the conference because it gives you time to dig in to a specific piece of software and learn some new skills, something I am quite poor at doing during my usual ‘day job’! I learnt some new useful skills in both workshops. Dennis has also shared the XYZ Mapping workshop materials if you have more discipline than me(!) and can work through it on your own:</p>
<ul>
<li>More details on the <a href="https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/">app itself</a></li>
<li>Start with <a href="https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/wiki/Getting-started">Getting started</a></li>
<li>Then look at the <a href="https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/mapp/tree/main/foss4g_workshop">workshop</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Drone workshop was also fascinating, and Ivan did a great job of both teaching us how to fly a drone (easier than I thought) and how to help local communities leverage the power of drones (&amp; wider GIS skills) for their own benefit.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-01-foss4g-belem-brazil/drone.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The main conference itself was in the Hanger Convention Centre and it was a great international conference. The laid back approach of FOSS4G always creates a lovely atmosphere and it was a great opportunity to get to know new people in the FOSS4G world, and catch up with people I have met at previous events. Community is one of the key things that I love about this group, with people very willing to help each other out. Uber is a key method of transportation in Brazil, and with a number of the evening social events in the city centre, we usually clubbed together at the hotel reception for an Uber to get us there, and back afterwards!</p>
<p>The variety of talks was incredible, with fascinating applications of FOSS4G tools, discussions on the interaction of academia and FOSS4G and personal reflections on people’s FOSS4G journeys. I particularly Kim Durante’s talk on <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2024/talk/NKBU8E/">FAIR Principles for Geospatial Data Curation</a> which might have some very useful ideas for a project I am working on at the moment, and Veronica Andreo’s talk, <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2024/talk/VCNPKB/">From field biology to the GRASS GIS board - an open source journey</a> about how she got involved in the GRASS GIS project.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2025-01-foss4g-belem-brazil/grass.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I met one lady from Brazil and this was her first international, English speaking conference. She was really enjoying herself and it was a great introduction to the FOSS4G community for her.</p>
<p>One thing that came across to me was the variety of open source projects, and how some projects seem to be doing very similar things. Two examples that come to mind are <a href="https://qfield.org/">QField</a> and <a href="https://merginmaps.com/">Mergin Maps</a>, both of which allow users to collect data in a QGIS project in the field on their phone, and process that data back in the office. Another pair would be <a href="https://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> and <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/">GRASS GIS</a>, both arguably great quality Desktop GIS tools, and there are many other examples too.</p>
<p>Initially I wondered why there were so many similar tools like this, when it might make more sense to combine effort and focus on one tool, rather than splitting our effort over two? However after a bit of reflection I discovered a) that often two similar tools have differences that make them more useful to different audiences. For example, QField is a more flexible field data collection tool, and Mergin Maps is easier to get up and running with. Also, b) having multiple tools reflects the market approach of encouraging development and innovation, with the best tool ‘winning’. In this context winning is not by having the highest revenues or the highest profits, but by having communities of users and developers. If a project doesn’t have a good group of users and/or a good group of developers interested in keeping the project up to date, then gradually it will fall out of use. I was not expecting to see an example of a capitalist based market in the open source community, but here it is!</p>
<p>I also had the opportunity to met Katja Haferkorn, who is the coordinator for FOSSGIS e.V. <a href="https://www.fossgis.de/">FOSSGIS e.V.</a> is the OSGeo Local Chapter for German-speaking countries - D-A-CH, i.e.&nbsp;Germany, Austria and the german speaking part of Switzerland. FOSSGIS e.V. is also the German local chapter for OpenStreetMap. FOSSGIS e.V. is quite unique in that they are a local chapter who has a paid coordinator - Katja - and it was fascinating to hear her experiences. As OSGeo:UK Chair, one of the questions I asked her was about diversity within Local Chapters, and OSGeo as a whole. This is an issue for them as well and it is a aspect of membership that has been challenging the whole community for a while. Katja has written a great <a href="https://www.fossgis.de/news/2024_12_07_bericht_foss4g-2024_belem/">blog post</a> about the conference. It is in German, but Google Translate does a reasonable job of translating it into English.</p>

<p>The last two days of the conference was the Code Sprint. This is a chance to meet people working on different open source GIS projects and learn how to contribute to different elements of the projects. I had a great chat with Silvina Meritano and Andrés Duhour about using R as a GIS. Silvina was keen to develop her mapping skills in R, and Andrés had already developed an R package (which he presented at the conference: <a href="https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2024/talk/GSBMGK/">osmlanduseR</a>) and spent a bit of time learning about and contributing to the new <code>tmap</code> library examples. <code>Tmap</code> version 4 is coming out (blog post coming soon!) and I needed to updated my material for this new version. I also spent some time looking at the <a href="https://geochicasosm.github.io/lascallesdelasmujeres/">Las Calles De Las Mujeres</a> project, which looks at the proportion of streets named after women (rather than men) in a range of Spanish speaking countries. Silvina and I had a go at creating a version in R that could automate some more of the process to apply this to different cities in English speaking countries.</p>
<p>The internet connection at the code sprint was a little variable, so we had some challenges and had to resort to using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">“sneaker net”</a> occasionally - using a USB stick to transfer data between us! Fortunately we never had to resort to playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truco">truco</a> - a card game played in Argentina when the internet doesn’t work and you have nothing else to do!</p>

  <title>FOSS4G:UK South West 2024 - Bristol</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-13-foss4guk-2024-sw/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It was great to attend <a href="https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2024/bristol.html">FOSS4G:UK South West 2024</a> in Bristol on 12th Nov, at OSGeo:UK’s now regular Bristol Venue, The Engine Shed. The event was a sell out and we had 62 people in the Engine Shed’s main room.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-13-foss4guk-2024-sw/engine-shed-room.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This was the first time in a while that I have been to a FOSS4G:UK as an attendee rather than as an organiser - and it made a nice difference! We had 14 great presentations, covering a whole range of topics including digitalization of railways, reproducible science, real time vessel monitoring, landscape heritage, open source funding, cloud native web apps and a whole variety of useful open source tools.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I missed the first presentation - thanks Great Western Railways! - but one common theme that cropped up a lot was how social media as a tool for open source projects has changed dramatically. <a href="https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2024/bristol.html">James Milner</a> said that social media used to be a great way to promote his program, Terra Draw, but know he gets no where near the same impact from using social media. It’s now a bit of a big unknown, and I particularly liked how he summarised this:</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-13-foss4guk-2024-sw/spiderman-meme.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Interestingly, I sent out a number of social media posts to Twitter (X), Mastodon and LinkedIn, and LinkedIn got the most response, so make of that what you will! Although I think it’s fair to say LinkedIn is not universally loved, as it was memorably described as “Grindr for Business” by Andrew Bailey!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://x.com/NickBearmanUK/status/1856285815321612304">Twitter (X)</a> 1 retweet, 7 likes</li>
<li><a href="https://fosstodon.org/deck/@osgeouk/113469557732201903">Mastodon</a> 3 boosts, 3 favorites</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7262052154012581891/">LinkedIn</a> 6 comments, 4 reposts</li>
</ul>
<p>The presenters have also mastered the use of memes, with <a href="https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2024/bristol.html">Matt Travis</a> hitting home with some of the perils of waiting for large data sets to load:</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-13-foss4guk-2024-sw/waiting.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>and of course also</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-13-foss4guk-2024-sw/waiting-2.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It was also fantastic to get FAIR Open Science and FAIR workflows mentioned in the presentation by <a href="https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2024/bristol.html">Richard Conway &amp; Garin Smith</a> from Telespazio, who are in the process of developing an exploration platform that allows researchers both to share their data, code and their methods in a reproducible form.</p>
<p>I also had the opportunity to speak about GoFundGeo and talk about how OSGeo:UK is funding a range of open source geospatial projects that will have an impact in the UK. Join the <a href="https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk">OSGeo:UK mailing list</a> or check the <a href="https://uk.osgeo.org/gofundgeo.html">website</a> to find out more.</p>

<p>Finally, as ever, it was great to meet new people and network again with old friends at these events. I know of at least one contract opportunity, as well a number of potential ones and also I think some new volunteers for OSGeo:UK!</p>
<p>Thanks very much to all the organisers - <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/pascalcoulon">Pascal Coulon</a>, <a href="https://social.vivaldi.net/@ajggeoger">Alastair Graham</a>, <a href="https://mapstodon.space/@samfranklin">Sam Franklin</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/danielormsby/">Dan Ormsby</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/illyasantos/">Illya Sparkes-Santos</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@antscott">Ant Scott</a>, as well as everyone who came along and took part.</p>

  <title>New Website - Quarto</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-09-new-website-quarto/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve been thinking for a bit of time that I need to redo my website as some of the pages had evolved a bit, and were getting a bit too long. What you see now is what I have come up with:</p>
<p><a href="../../"><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-09-new-website-quarto/website-homepage.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I also took the opportunity to ‘rebrand’ myself. Previously I’d used the name Geospatial Training Solutions to market my freelance work. I was never completely happy with the name - it was a bit long and a bit generic - and after some thought I decided I would be better trading under my own name - Nick Bearman - as that is a name already known in the GIS community and it is me that I am selling. I am freelance and have no current plans to expand or to hire other people - I am just me!</p>
<p>Anyway, once I’d made that decision, the question was how to make my new website. I’ve been using WordPress which worked reasonably well, but it has a relatively complex infrastructure under the hood (database, etc.) which:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>opens it up to more vulnerabilities and</p></li>
<li><p>upgrading WordPress was always something that needed to be done every so often, and then I had to make sure everything worked as I wanted.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I looked around and found various examples that were similar to what I wanted to achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kate Berg / Pokateo <a href="https://pokateomaps.com">https://pokateomaps.com</a> Wix</li>
<li>James Cheshire <a href="https://jcheshire.com/">https://jcheshire.com/</a> WordPress</li>
<li>Mike Spencer <a href="https://mikerspencer.com/">https://mikerspencer.com/</a> Start Bootstrap - Agency (using Respond.js)</li>
<li>Alessia Calafiore <a href="https://aelissa.github.io/">https://aelissa.github.io/</a> Hydejack theme on Jekyll</li>
<li>Caitlin Robinson <a href="https://www.caitlin-h-robinson.com/">https://www.caitlin-h-robinson.com/</a> Wix</li>
<li>Andy Kirk <a href="https://visualisingdata.com/">https://visualisingdata.com/</a> WordPress</li>
<li>Robin Wilson <a href="https://rtwilson.com">https://rtwilson.com</a> Jekyll</li>
</ul>
<p>I mostly used these to think about content, but it was also helpful to consider the different technologies as well. More people were using WordPress that I thought, and often they were not ‘obviously’ WordPress sites. I wanted something simple, and certainly something I could update easily. Easy of updating was a common theme! To quote Pokateo / Kate:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-09-new-website-quarto/pokateo-tweet.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>From <a href="https://x.com/pokateo_maps/status/1473766842661539840">https://x.com/pokateo_maps/status/1473766842661539840</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>At this point, Quarto had been released and they had some interesting possibilities for websites. I’d dabbled a bit with Quarto for PDF documents and websites (including <a href="https://www.rgs.org/research/higher-education-resources/a-geographers-introduction-to-qgis">A geographer’s introduction to QGIS &amp; R</a>) after using RMarkdown for several years. Quarto looked ideal, so I started experimenting with it. It is plain text, and can work with GitHub, which I am using fairly regularly.</p>
<p>Quarto also has a very good website, with lots of examples including creating a website <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/">https://quarto.org/docs/websites/</a> and you can also choose from a variety of different themes <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">https://bootswatch.com/</a>.</p>
<p>After various rounds of development, I came up with this site, https://nickbearman.github.io/. It is (I hope) a simple site which has what I need on it. It also supports blogs, which I do contribute to semi-regularly. It is also all static pages, so once it is updated it can just sit there and doesn’t need any database provision or anything else to run. The new site also incorporated a search, which is handy.</p>
<p>You can host it through GitHub Pages, and there are various options to automatically compile it using continuous integration, but I decided to keep things simple, to compile the site locally and the push to GitHub. Sometimes the potential to automate things isn’t worth the time to set it up!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>Transferring my blog posts from WordPress (geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk and nickbearman.me.uk) was a bit of a faff but it is getting there. It is a work in progress. I have found a <a href="https://johnowhitaker.dev/tils/2023-08-11-convert_wordpress_to_quarto.html#:~:text=I%20used%20https%3A%2F%2Fgithub,folder%20in%20your%20quarto%20blog">semi-automated</a> way of doing this, but it will still take some time. I’m also trying to extract a static copy of the WordPress sites for archiving, with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/">Simpy Static</a> WordPress plugin looking useful.</p>
<p>I also used to have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckfjf0U43ysotj4sS68bZ85DHijqTSy3vJcdBa5oC275TwUg/viewform">contact form</a>, which I received some useful contacts through so I wanted to include this. Quarto as such doesn’t include such a form, as there is no interaction, but I had a brainwave and decided to use a Google Forms instead.

  <title>OCG Open Standards Code Sprint, Geovation, London, UK</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In July I spent three days at <a href="https://geovation.uk/">Geovation</a> in London attending the OGC Open Standards Code Sprint. OGC, the <a href="https://www.ogc.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> manage and approve standards for geospatial data. Many people working in geospatial have heard of them, and have at least a vague idea that they do geospatial standards, even if they don’t know the details of what they do - the position I was in! Dr.&nbsp;Gobe Hobona, Director of Product Management, Standards at OGC, is a regular attendee at FOSS4G:UK and other geo related conferences, and recommended I come along.</p>

<p>I’ve attended some Code Sprints before, including FOSS4G 2022 in Florence but I had never attended a OGC Code Sprint before. They run 4 or 5 a year, each with a different theme, and run one every year in London, usually at Geovation. Gobe had recommended I attend, and as London is relatively accessible for me (compared to Évora, Portugal; St.&nbsp;Louis, MO, US or Geneva, Switzerland; there other venues) I thought I would go along.</p>
<section id="mentor-stream" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mentor-stream">Mentor Stream</h2>
<p>Given that OGC were running it, the focus was on standards, as you would expect. However they don’t require a knowledge of standards to attend - they welcome people with any knowledge of OGC standards, including none. For these folks, and those new to code sprints, they run a mentor stream on the first day, running a series of sessions on each of the standards being discussed at the code sprint. This time this included Adding Support to a new OGC API in pygeoapi, SensorThings API WebSub Extension, Consuming OGC API - Connected Systems through OWSLIB and Applying TrainingDML-AI among others, with a short presentation and discussion given by the senior people involved with that standard attending the code sprint.</p>
<p>This code sprint was hybrid, with some people attending online via Discord (including one of the mentor stream presenters). Discord worked well, with a number of channels for different discussions based around topics as well as the mentor stream. We had about 20 people attending in person, with another 6-8 attending online.</p>
<p>Attending the mentor stream was a good starting point, but after a bit of reflection, I discovered that I am not a “standards person”. I have always slightly struggled with policy aspects, one of the reasons I have not pursued my work with <a href="../2023-05-geoai-digital-twins/index.html">ethics &amp; the Locus Charter</a>. However I discovered I wasn’t the only person there who wasn’t a “standards person”. I found some of the standards quite abstract and didn’t really manage to see how some of them relate to my every day work with geospatial data.</p>
</section>
<section id="training-dml-ai" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-dml-ai">Training DML-AI</h2>
<p>One particular standard being developed was the Training ML standard, which was trying to develop automated ways of developing metadata for AI Training Data. I am no AI expert, but even I have picked up on the recent growth in AI and related terms. One key aspect of any AI is that it needs training data - in a very similar way to a supervised classification of a satellite image from remote sensing. A small sample of the data is categorised by a human, sometimes by us (<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/captcha-if-you-can-how-youve-been-training-ai-for-years-without-realising-it">Google</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/?zbcode=inc5000">reCAPTCHA</a>). For example, this scene has cars in it, in this CCTV there is a bike, this image has a lake in it, etc. Then this 10-20% of the data is used to train the AL model, which then classifies the rest of the data.</p>
<p>So there are many different ways of identifying and classifying a) the training data itself (how much, resolution, etc.) and b) what training process has been applied to it (how much trained, by whom, when, what labels, etc.). There is no systematic way of recording who did what to this data. If we want people to be able to reuse this training data, we need to record this information. Ideally we want this to be machine readable so a) when data is used for training this metadata can be recorded automatically (as very few people bother to record metadata, even when it is required) and b) when the training data is used in other models, some judgement can be made about whether the training data is appropriate for the model it is being applied to.</p>
<p>This topic appealed to me as I could clearly see the benefit of this. The <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/TrainingDML-AI_SWG">standard</a> has a GitHub repository, which also makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/openrsgis/pytdml">pytdml library</a> which provides some of the tools to do this. Unfortunately the library and related tutorial didn’t work as expected - partly because there were some changes to the library the day before the session, and partly because the planned Jupyter Notebook wasn’t able to be developed in time for the session.</p>
<p>This library was in Python and I am not a Python expert. I was struggling to get it to work, and fortunately I had the benefit of Daniel’s experience to help me with this (someone else attending the code sprint). I wasn’t experienced enough to know whether I was doing something wrong, or whether the library was broken. He reassured me that it was the library that wasn’t working, rather than me getting things wrong!</p>
<p>Getting help from others is one of the big benefits of attending a code sprint and I got much further with the tutorial that I would have had I been on my own. Each day we also had a “stand up” at the beginning to say briefly what we were going to do and a “brief back” at the end to say what we had done. In these people shared their experiences and I think it’s fair to say most people progressed quite slowly. Many people didn’t get a huge amount done on the first day and it was reassuring that I wasn’t the only one not making a lot of progress! In fact, someone who had a reasonable amount of experience had essentially a days work that ended up being no use! He had two routes to take to develop a certain feature - the easy route or the hard route. He started off spending a day working on the easy route and then realised it was a dead end - so had to start again on next day with the hard route! It’s very reassuring that everyone goes through this process - newbie or experienced.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Over the code sprint I learnt quite a bit more about Python and how it works with different packages and virtual environments. I also experience <a href="https://medium.com/knerd/the-nine-circles-of-python-dependency-hell-481d53e3e025">Python dependency hell</a>, with circular dependencies meaning we had to do various unpicking’s of both my setup and the library to work out what was going on.</p>
</section>
<section id="r-tmap-v4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-tmap-v4">R tmap v4</h2>
<p>I also spent a bit of time working on the R tmap library. I was the only person working on R there (probably partly because this clashed with the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/user/">UseR</a> conference so many R Spatial people were there in Salzburg, Austria!). Tmap version 4 is coming, so I needed to re-write some of my practical workbooks to make the mapping code work with version 4. V4 isn’t out on CRAN yet, but I want to be prepared when it is released, which I think will be later this year. See <a href="https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/">these</a> <a href="https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/news/index.html?q=v3#tmap-40">pages</a> for more details. I <a href="https://github.com/nickbearman/confident-spatial-analysis/commit/5ebcce53abe68164d03481bcfd3eceb6c70e23b3">updated</a> the code for one of my courses I am running this <a href="https://nickbearman.github.io/training-courses.html#confident-spatial-analysis-and-statistics-in-r-geoda">week</a>. I also added a little bit of information to the tmap website so it is a bit clearer to new uses that tmap 4 is coming and some suggestions as to how the code has changes and how they can try it out: short version - try it on <a href="https://posit.cloud">posit.cloud</a> rather than risk messing up your current installation!</p>
</section>
<section id="demo-wrap-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="demo-wrap-up">Demo &amp; Wrap-up</h2>
<p>At the end of the code sprint we had a demo and wrap up where everyone demoed what they did and it was fascinating to see what people had done. I also discovered a new QGIS plugin <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/met-office-introduces-qgis-ogc-edr-plugin-matt-wardle-axgpe/">(EDR)</a> and as I mentioned I was working in R, I had a couple of interesting discussions about how R package management compares with Pythons package management.</p>
<p>Overall I am glad I gave the OGC Code Sprint a try. I’m not sure whether I would do it again; it’s good to see what people are doing in the geospatial standards world and have some time to try bits out, but I really struggled with a lack of concrete examples that were relevant to my experience. If you are interested in standards in general, or they are working on a specific standard or tool you are interested then I would really recommend attending. If there are any code sprints on spatial tools in R, then I will certainly be attending if I can!</p>
<p>If this has got you interest, I am involved in running Code by the Coast, OSGeo:UK’s next Code Sprint on 30th July in Portland, Dorset, UK. We are running this as an in-person event only. Check out the <a href="https://uk.osgeo.org/code-sprint-2024.html">website</a> for more details. We will have groups working on Terra Draw, GIFramework and Registering your project as a OSGeo Community project. I may even be doing some R work too!</p>

  <title>ArcMap: 1999 to 2024</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-01-arcmap-1999-2024/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>We finally have an end date for ArcMap! This has been something that has been a long time coming, but I would say is certainly due now. ArcMap final date of support for software updates and patches has been announced as Feb 2024. ESRI launched ArcGIS Pro, the replacement for ArcMap, several years ago and people have been slowly transitioning.</p>
<p>ArcMap holds a special place in my heart because it is the software that I learnt GIS on. I first came across it in my undergraduate Geography degree at University of Leicester in 2003 - introduced to me by a certain Prof.&nbsp;Nick Tate if I remember correctly. This was the first time I had come across the combination of Geography and Computer Science and the subject suited me down to the ground.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-01-arcmap-1999-2024/arcmap-screenshot.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" alt="I also spent a lot of time working with ArcMap 9.2 (shown in the picture), which I used in my programming skills to use VBA (Visual Basic Applications) code to create a map that made sounds – an area called sonification, which formed part of my early research interests."></p>

</div>
<p>Later on, I also spent a lot of time working with ArcMap 9.2 (above), which I used in my programming skills to use VBA (Visual Basic Applications) code to create a map that made sounds - an area called <a href="../../writing-presentations.html#sonification---phd">sonification</a>, which formed part of my early research interests.</p>
<p>Things have certainly changed in the 20+ years since 2003. ArcMap itself progressed from version 8.3 all the way up to the now retiring version 10.8.2. Of course we have also seen the rise of open source: QGIS in particular as a competitor to ArcMap, and now potentially better than ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro, depending exactly who you are and what you are trying to-do.</p>
<p>We’ve also seen the rise (again) of scripting. With R leading the way and Python a performing a quick catch-up, the combination of easier to use software and ease of access to the benefits of scripting has seen GIS become much more accessible than it was 20 years ago. Some colleagues who have been using GIS longer than I have remember the days of AML, ArcInfo and Sun Microsystems - all of which used command line interfaces to work with data. Much of this was to handle larger data sets than was easy to do in a graphical interface with limited computer resources - much the same situation we see now with big data and bigger computers - but still with limited computer power to process that data.</p>
<p>I was saddened to hear that some students are still being taught ArcMap:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2024-01-arcmap-1999-2024/kate-quote-twitter.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><em>From</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/pokateo_maps/status/1747717333211373896"><em>https://twitter.com/pokateo_maps/status/1747717333211373896</em></a></p>
<p>For anyone teaching GIS now, ArcMap is not the tool to teach. It has been a long hard road of transition from ArcMap and I know moving software is not easy, but if anyone is still teaching ArcMap, I very much hope this is its final year. Of course anyone who would like help transitioning, ESRI provide a range of very good materials and I also have good consultancy rates - just <a href="https://nickbearman.github.io/">get in touch</a>!</p>
<p>One constant challenge in the geospatial environment is that the tools and technologies constantly change - and we see this across the board of geospatial. My advice to anyone coming into this area is to at least keep up with the changes and have an idea of what is happening, even if you don’t use the cutting edge in your own work. Much of GIS’s power is in its versatility and you can get 80% of this benefit with only learning 20% of the tools! Also that 20% of knowledge will easily transfer between QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, online web maps and many other GIS.</p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to the next 20 years, and who knows what it will hold?!</p>
<p>Best of luck with your GIS work!</p>

  <title>ICC, Cape Town, South Africa – 3D Models and UN Acronym Soup</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2023-09-icc/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A couple of weeks ago I spent a fantastic week in Cape Town, South Africa, attending the <a href="https://icc2023.org/">2023 International Cartographic Conference</a>. The ICC (not to be confused with the International Cricket Council!) is held every two years by the International Cartographic Association (ICA). It’s a global conference, and this is the second time it has taken place in South Africa, previously being hosted in Durban in 2003.</p>
<p>The conference covers everything under the umbrella of Cartography and GIScience, with papers ranging from user assessments to theoretical discussions, covering topics as wide as cartographic methods, generalisation, COVID, navigation, education, spatial data infrastructures and many many other topics. There is plenty of overlap with the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tcag20/current">Cartography and Geographic Information Science journal (CaGIS Journal)</a> and a number of us from the academic board were attending to present our work, connect with authors and discover new articles. I work as Cartographic Editor for CaGIS, and it was great to see some published work presented, and discover new authors who might write for the journal.</p>
<section id="d-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="d-models">3D Models</h2>
<p>I was particularly impressed by work developing methods to provide 3D models with interactive elements to people who are blind or visually impaired. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15230406.2022.2105747">Jakub Wabiński developed a 3D printed tactile model which has been published in CaGIS</a> and <a href="https://ica-abs.copernicus.org/articles/6/26/2023/ica-abs-6-26-2023.pdf">Jan Brus</a> and <a href="https://ica-abs.copernicus.org/articles/6/16/2023/ica-abs-6-16-2023.pdf">Radek Barvir</a> presented a process to 3D print models with conductive elements so users can press on certain locations which then prompts a mobile phone to play a verbal recording describing that feature.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2023-09-icc/2023-08-17-14.19.17-crop-1024x682.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The 3D model uses conductive strips to link the touch on designated areas of the 3D model to the tablet underneath, which then pays the relevant audio narration. This allows many different relatively cheap 3D printed models to be used with one tablet.</p>
</section>
<section id="un-acronym-soup" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="un-acronym-soup">UN Acronym Soup</h2>
<p>The ICA is quite a large organisation with a long history, and has good links with a number of United Nations (UN) groups and initiatives, including <a href="https://ggim.un.org/">UN GGIM - UN Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management</a> and <a href="https://ggim.un.org/UN-IGIF/">UN IGIF - Integrated Geospatial Information Framework</a>. The IGIF is a multidimensional framework that provides countries with a basis for developing, integrating, strengthening, and benefiting from geospatial information management. There is a risk of drowning in acronym soup when it comes to working with the UN, and I had some great discussions when asking a number of people how UN groups and initiatives like GGIM or IGIF have made an impact in the real world. I had a range of different answers, from ‘I have no idea!’ to ‘having these programmes is better than nothing, so they probably have some impact’ to some much more detailed responses (see below).</p>
<p>To me, it was certainly clear that the UN could do a better job of explaining what it is doing in the area of geospatial in a way that can be easily understood. However, there are some great outputs from a variety of UN departments. Firstly, there are the Sustainable Development Goals, which is probably one of their most well known activities:</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2023-09-icc/english_SDG_17goals_poster_all_languages_with_UN_emblem_1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The 17 Sustainable Development Goals are often illustrated using this image, or a variation of it. Originally from <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/12/sustainable-development-goals-kick-off-with-start-of-new-year/" class="uri">https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/12/sustainable-development-goals-kick-off-with-start-of-new-year/</a>.</p>
<p>These are something many people have heard of, and provide a series of targets to help all countries develop sustainably. Many others can describe them better than I can (see the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/12/sustainable-development-goals-kick-off-with-start-of-new-year/">UN</a>, <a href="https://www.concern.org.uk/news/explained-sustainable-development-goals?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi7GnBhDXARIsAFLvH4lM4-bHBBC_fEf5it4RH2z7FtYKMrD4tblEeo2g38dO33BIUgiYMwwaAqsEEALw_wcB">Concern</a>), one of the keynote presentations at the conference from Greg Scott and even <a href="https://www.concern.org.uk/news/explained-sustainable-development-goals?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi7GnBhDXARIsAFLvH4lM4-bHBBC_fEf5it4RH2z7FtYKMrD4tblEeo2g38dO33BIUgiYMwwaAqsEEALw_wcB">Google</a>)) but one striking image is the discussion of how to measure the progress in achieving these goals, and the fact that for a number of the goals some countries are actually going backwards. Managing the data for these is a key issue, and a number of goals are quite difficult to measure, with some countries not having the data to be able to measure the progress (or lack thereof). It is possible that in comes cases this may be deliberate (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/white-house-raimondo-will-tell-china-that-us-is-not-seeking-decouple-2023-08-22/">for example, China reducing the number of statistics they publish because they were showing a bad message</a>) but I think in most of the cases it is because a) the goals are tricky to measure and b) they often require specific resources which may not be available.</p>
<p>Returning to UN GGIM &amp; IGIF, accessibility of data is one of the key focus areas of the UN GGIM. One of their core aims is helping all countries develop their spatial data infrastructures, that is the national organisations that manage, maintain and make accessible their spatial data. The UN IGIF is a framework that will help countries in this process - highlighting best practice and examples of how to do this. Of course every country is at a different stage in the process, but from discussions at the ICC, every country is keen to progress their work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ogc.org/about/team/gobe-hobona-ph-d/">Gobe Hobona</a> from the OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) gave me a very good explanation of IGIF, which formed part of the description above. He also compared it to INSPIRE, which is the European Union (EU) initiative on spatial data infrastructure, and is probably 10-15 years ahead of IGIF. INSPIRE has provided a framework for structuring spatial data and metadata across the EU, and therefore making data (including spatial data) much more accessible by providing information about it in a structured way. Similar initiatives exist in the UK, for example on the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> site - you can search for many different UK government related data sets there, and one of the key underpinning structures is Gemini which makes this possible. More specifically, the <a href="https://www.agi.org.uk/uk-gemini/">Gemini standard</a> is a profile of the ISO 19115 standard that facilitates conformance to <a href="https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1037-uk-gemini-standard-and-inspire-implementing-rules/">INSPIRE metadata implementing rules</a>. A common thread across many of the geospatial data initiatives and frameworks is that they make use of OGC Standards.</p>
</section>
<section id="mapping-for-a-sustainable-world" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mapping-for-a-sustainable-world">Mapping for a Sustainable World</h2>
<p>Another great output from the UN is <a href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826?ln=en0">Mapping for a Sustainable World</a>, which is a fantastic publication from a collaboration from the UN and the ICA (ICC). It’s a free book, available as a PDF, covering two main aims. Firstly, it discusses how maps can be used to help monitor progress across all (13) sustainable development goals, for example Goal 5: Gender Equality.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2023-09-icc/un-msw-gender-equality-1024x728.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>As example of applying spatial data to the Sustainable Development Goals. Page 54 &amp; 55 from <a href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826?ln=en0">Mapping for a Sustainable World</a>.</p>
<p>As well as discussing the availability of spatial data, it also covers practically every key aspect of working with spatial data and GIS (projections, MAUP, classification, scale, generalisation, colour, typography and so on), it also gives examples of 14 different types of map (thematic, nominal, choropleth, etc.) and discusses different environments for map use (both in terms of audience and medium).</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to meet one of the co authors, <a href="https://bricker0.github.io/">Britta Ricker</a>, at the CaGIS reception, and heard about some of the challenges in pulling this book together, including methods that are not well known, but potentially very useful (e.g.&nbsp;dasymetric mapping), and UN’s approach to boundaries (e.g how to show disputed areas such as Tiwain, Crimea, Israel/Palestine, etc.). This is a well known geographical issue, as discussed shown in <a href="https://documentation.maptiler.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405462162065-Disputed-borders-on-your-maps">MapTiler</a>, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/how-does-google-maps-handle-disputed-territories-5544baa2a91b">Go</a>o<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2016/aug/10/google-maps-disputed-territories-palestineishere">gl</a>e, <a href="https://theworld.org/stories/2019-12-10/how-do-maps-handle-disputed-borders">Apple Maps</a>, and even as discussed by <a href="https://jcheshire.com/christmas/the-contested-borders-on-my-christmas-tree/">James Cheshire on Christmas decorations</a>! The UN also has a standard detailing these issues, as well as maps people can use themselves, including official UN boundaries in their web maps.</p>
<p>They had some print copies available in English and French at the conference, and both can be downloaded as PDFs for free from <a href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826?ln=en0" class="uri">https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826?ln=en0</a>.</p>
<p>As well as seeing a wide range of presentations across the whole range of Cartography and GIScience (let me know if you’re interested in publishing in CaGIS!), it was great to meet and network with a whole range of people passionate about cartography and GIScience from around the world. This conference also included a record proportion of attendees from both the African continent (450 and South Africa itself (385), which was fantastic to see (stats from map of attendee home country on <a href="https://icc2023.org/" class="uri">https://icc2023.org/</a>). A number of those I spoke to said they would be unable to attend if the conference was outside Africa due to funding restrictions, so it was great for them to have this opportunity.</p>

  <title>ESRI UK &amp; GeoBusiness: GeoAI &amp; Digital Twins</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Along with many other people from the geospatial community, I was up in London earlier this week for ESRI UK Annual Conference, GeoBusiness and Spatial Data Science Conference. It was a great couple of days, and while I didn’t manage to attend everything (limited time, money and energy!) it was great to see and hear what I did.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.esriuk.com/en-gb/about/events/ac/overview">ESRI UK’s Annual Conference</a> had a couple fewer streams than usual, but it was still as busy. I also managed to get into one of the over subscribed training sessions, to see what had changed in ArcGIS Online recently. Digital twins were mentioned quite a bit, developing from my blog post about <a href="https://www.geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk/esri-uk-geobusiness-digital-twins-or-just-digial-offspring/">last year’s conference</a>, and the vocabulary is evolving and the focus has now shifted to how they are actually useful.</p>
<p>Jurassic Fibre gave a great presentation about how their as-built survey validation process made use of in field tools to collect and verify data. They were comparing what was planned to be built against what was actually built, and had some great processes for managing this. It really shows not just how important data is, but also how important how linking different teams together is important to deliver a service.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Discussions and catching-up at ESRI UK annual conference I also had some really useful discussions about sharing data between platforms – some people use ArcGIS, some use QGIS, some R, and so on. Everyone has good reasons for using the software they do, and it would be a hard struggle to get everyone (in a team, group or even organisation) to use the same software – and more often that not will be a waste of time. What can be done is to help everyone make use of the same data, and / or share data in exchangeable formats.</p>
<p>Accessibility also had a focus in the end keynote presentation, combined with ChatGPT. Large language models create great potential for interacting with maps and spatial data in a different way – a prototype demo showed how a user could verbally ask for information about a map, and the computer could give a verbal summary. No where near production yet, but it shows what could happen. There is a huge amount of potential here – with developing better interfaces for those suffering from visual impairment – or for better natural language interaction with maps. This linked a bit in with my <a href="../../writing-presentations.html#sonification---phd">PhD work</a>, from 2008-2011, focusing on sonification, where I used sound to represent data in combination with vision. There are some videos and code <a href="../../writing-presentations.html#sonification">demonstrating this</a> (I’m sure the VBA code in ArcMap will no longer work, not the Google Maps API code, but the videos how how it worked!), as well as my PhD thesis itself.</p>
<p>https://vimeo.com/22290435</p>
<p>Sonification – from a few years ago 😉</p>
<p>Will ChatGPT replace GIS Analysts? I don’t think so, so we will all still have jobs! It will certainly change what we can do, and some jobs will change. With any LLM, you need to know how to ask the right question as well as being able to understand the answer that comes back. Ultimately the skills will be in interpreting the results, and making a judgement call about whether it is useful or not. Google revolutionised the internet when it was launched – and LLMs will be no different. As ever, we always need to be critical of maps and spatial analysis output – and ChatGPT or Bard or any other LLM will not change that. If anything, it will make it more important!</p>
<ul>
<li>“So don’t just use GIS, but use it critically.”</li>
</ul>
<p>I also popped into the Spatial Data Science Conference party in Wednesday night, and it sounds like the conference was fantastic – next time perhaps!</p>
<p>GeoBusiness followed ESRI AC UK, with a huge range of geo related businesses hosting stands and presenting talks. The stands were very equipment focused, with many new drones and surveying tool available to have a look at and discuss. However I was more interested in the talks and networking opportunities. The skills shortage was again raised as an issue, with not enough people available with geospatial skills. However speaking with those at the coal faces, new graduate with geospatial skills are being tempted away with starting salaries of £5k – £10k more for similar roles outside geospatial (e.g.&nbsp;programming) and even more for data science roles. It’s a hard ask for someone to give up £5k – £10k a year to stay in geospatial!</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2023-05-geoai-digital-twins/geobusiness-crop-300x146.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Developing skills of people coming into geospatial is something that is of particular interest to me, with a range of initiatives around training and skills development. While many users are big ESRI clients, there is certainly an increase in people wanting to use ESRI along side open source solutions – particularly QGIS. I see lots of potential for <a href="https://north-road.com/slyr/">North Road’s SLYR tool</a>, what they term: the ESRI to QGIS Compatibility Suite.</p>
<p>There are so many novel applications of GI data and one in particular caught my eye – ClearSky, a product from <a href="https://aspiaspace.com/">Aspia Space</a>, have created a AI algorithm which converts uses cloud-penetrating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to create cloudless multispectral imaging, right across the visible and short-wave infrared spectrum. This allows a ‘cloud-free’ view of satellite imagery – an interesting and valuable resource.</p>
<p>A different, but potentially equally useful application of GIS data was presented by Christopher Jackson from <a href="https://www.geobusinessshow.com/programme/#mec-speaker-info-92282-713">Advanced Infrastructure</a> talking about geospatial tools for energy. They have created an application to help local councils estimate where it may be viable to install electric car charging points. The GIS analysis itself is not that ground breaking, as they are looking at a combination of IMD data, street width and electricity supply provision data to estimate feasibility and cost of electric car charging point installation – but the fact they think this is worth building into a product that can be sold is. It shows how vital geospatial data is and reminds me of the fact that there are still many people out there who don’t know what geospatial is. Communicating this is one thing we could all do better at.</p>
<p>It was great to see so many people, and chat about upcoming projects and opportunities, including FOSS4G:UK 2023 – watch this space(s) for more details soon: <a href="https://uk.osgeo.org/">OS</a><a href="https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk">Geo</a>:<a href="https://twitter.com/osgeouk">UK</a>!</p>

  <title>FOSS4G: Travelling by Train to Florence, Italy (from Weymouth, UK)</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2022-11-foss4g-2022/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I recently attended my first international FOSS4G conference in Florence (Firenze), Italy, in August 2022. For those who don’t know, FOSS4G is Free and Open Source for (4) Geospatial, so all of the people involved in open source geospatial software (e.g.&nbsp;QGIS, R-Spatial, Geoserver, Mapserver, GRASS, etc. etc.) get together. It is a great opportunity to meet up with the community, get to know people who you might only have met online, and find out about the latest developments. There are some great write-ups online about the conference – <a href="https://t.co/L91NSeHc8n">check</a> <a href="https://experimentalcraft.wordpress.com/2022/09/01/reflections-on-foss4g-2022-firenze-italia/">them</a> out.</p>
<p>I decided to travel from the UK by train to Florence, and this post is about that journey – in both senses of booking it, and travelling it. I wanted to do this a) to see if it was possible and how easy it was, and b) to reduce my carbon footprint by getting the train rather than flying. I’ve also got some photos of my trip on <a href="https://twitter.com/NickBearmanUK/status/1560967658111225857">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>The first place to spend a bit of time is seat61.com – this is a great website run by Mark Smith who does all sorts of train travel across the world. My trip to Florence is bit a tame compared to some of the trips on there, but it was a great resource. Seat61 directed me to Rail Europe, where I booked all of my trains beyond Paris. Working out the timings was a little complex, but with the help of suggested routes, I got something worked out.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2022-11-foss4g-2022/twitter.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>My planned outbound itinerary was:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Weymouth – London – Paris – Geneva</p></li>
<li><p>night in Geneva</p></li>
<li><p>Geneva – Milan – Florence</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Return:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Florence – Turin</p></li>
<li><p>night in Turin</p></li>
<li><p>Turin – Paris – London – Weymouth</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I booked these about ~2 months beforehand (in June), and the cost breakdown was:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Weymouth to London (SWR, return): £70</p></li>
<li><p>London to Paris (Eurostar, return): £219</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rail Europe (out):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Paris to Geneva (SNCF, single): €129 ~£112.91</p></li>
<li><p>(night in Geneva CHF90, ~£80.90)</p></li>
<li><p>Geneva – Milan (Trenitalia): €60 ~£52.52</p></li>
<li><p>Milan – Florence (Trenitalia): €39.90 ~£34.92</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Return:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Florence – Turin: €50 ~£44.50</p></li>
<li><p>Turin – Paris (TGV): €99 ~£86.65</p></li>
<li><p>Paris – London (included in return above)</p></li>
<li><p>London – Weymouth (included in return above)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the currency changes, I paid £341.95 to Rail Europe, so a total of £630.95 for my train travel.</p>
<p>One alternative I didn’t manage to find was sleeper trains. Night jet has recently gained in popularity since I booked this, so there might be some alternative routes there.</p>
<p>There is now an overnight option to <a href="https://www.seat61.com/Italy.htm#london-to-venice-by-sleeper">Venice</a>, but this wasn’t an option when I started looking, and Venice is a bit out of the way to get to Florence.</p>
<p>My planned itinerary got slightly mangled because of the rail strikes in the UK, so I ended up having to travel from Exeter to London (rather than Weymouth) and have a extra night stay in London – but I managed to catch the ‘Back to the Future’ musical, so the extra night had some compensations.</p>
<p>Beyond that, everything went as planned and I arrived in Florence on time, at 1400 on Monday.</p>
<p>The SCNF Connect app – the equivalent of the National Rail app for France &amp; Italy. One thing to remember – when travelling on Eurostar, the queue at St Pancras was very very long, but they were very efficient so even though there were many people there, I had plenty of time for my train – I arrived and got through the queue, check-in, security and both sets of border control (leaving UK and entering France) in 45 min.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2022-11-foss4g-2022/signal-2022-11-24-121130_002-461x1024.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I’d also recommend the SCNF Connect app – a great app which will give you train details with updates and platforms.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/NickBearmanUK/status/1560967658111225857">Twitter thread</a> for some photos of the various different trains I was on.</p>
<p>It was a great trip, and I really enjoyed it. It certainly took longer and cost more, but for me, it was worthwhile. Let me know about your train adventures!</p>

  <title>FOSS4G:UK Local 2022</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>On PostGIS day last week, Thurs 17th Nov, we ran <a href="https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2022local/">FOSS4G:UK Local 2022</a>. We were trying out a new model, with the conference distributed over 9 different physical venues (and online). I chaired three amazing keynotes, which were streamed to all the venues and on the internet. We then had 38 local presentations across the nine venues, with most of them streamed and recorded.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2022-11-foss4guklocal2022/twitter.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Overall the day went really well, and we had some great feedback from participants and presenters. One great aspect was once the presentations were completed, they were available on YouTube more or less instantly.</p>
<p>We had 246 people attending in person, and I think reached about another 50 online. Anyone could watch the streams online so it’s tricky to know exactly, but the first keynote had about 100 views as it finished, so assuming some double counting (people in the rooms who were on the YouTube stream) I think we can say we reached about 300 people. This is much greater than our usual in person conferences so I’m pleased to say we managed to increase our reach and get more people involved in FOSS4G:UK.</p>

<figcaption>(Some of) the local venues, including Keyworth, Glasgow, Leeds, London, Cardiff and Southampton (we also had Bovey Tracy, Bristol and Manchester, not shown)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Our multi venue streaming didn’t quite work out as planned initially – our first session had some technical problems so a number of the talks didn’t stream. But everyone was very forgiving, so thanks to all the good will in the community.</p>
<p>For the keynotes, we had a Jitsi meeting which each of the venues and presentors joined. We could then share cameras as usual in a video conferencing meeting, and it was great to see all of the venues share their cameras in the welcome section:</p>
<p>The Jitsi call was then streamed to YouTube. We then collated questions via the YouTube chat and the Matrix room we had running. Theoretically we people could have asked questions in the room (relayed via the Admin WhatsApp group we were running) but it was easier for people to type directly in the Matrix room or YouTube chat, even if they were physically in the room. See this post (coming soon, I will circulate to the OSGeo:UK mailing list when published) for some more technical details, and lessons learned.</p>
<p>We’re very much looking forward to the next one, and I hope you can be involved – join the <a href="https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk">OSGeo:UK mailing list</a> to stay up to date.</p>

  <title>ESRI UK &amp; GeoBusiness: Digital Twins or just Digial Offspring?</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2022-05-digital-twins/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Last week I attended the first ESRI UK Annual Conference (17th May) and the first GEO Business conference (18th &amp; 19th May) for three years (although GEO Business had a conference last autumn, which I didn’t manage to attend). It was great to be back at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre for the ESRI UK Annual Conference – it is always a great opportunity to meet colleagues working in GIS in the UK across all industries. Clearly open source didn’t feature that much (!) but all of the ESRI tools were showcased and it was a great opportunity to see what is coming up over the next year.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>ESRI UK Annual Conference at QEII Centre, Westminster, London</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>ESRI UK Annual Conference at QEII Centre, Westminster, London Sustainability was the key theme of the conference, “GIS – Creating a Sustainable Future”, with the Met Office delivering the keynote focusing on climate change. I actually missed their presentation (a long train journey!) but hearing from other participants it sounded a good presentation, although there was the question of how we turn talk about climate change at the conference into action that makes a real difference in the world.</p>
<p>ESRI were very keen to push the ArcGIS Suite as a set of capabilities and focusing on what you can do with their tools, rather than the tools themselves. Highlights include new graph data structures now available in ArcGIS Pro, the versatility of LiDAR data and ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online, ESRI’s response to Google Earth Engine allowing processing of large satellite data in the cloud. On that note, ArcGIS Online was first launched ten years ago – which was a slight shock to many attendees! It has gone from strength to strength – and I do like how the ArcGIS products have made GIS more accessible to new users.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Hub also featured prominaty as a way of collating information and making it avaialbe to non-GIS users. We also heard about deep learning models being features in the Living Atlas, real time vechicle tracking (although interestingly no mention of ethics), and greater links with AutoDesk billed as ArcGIS GeoBIM. ESRI are also very keen on pushing greater use of the cloud – either provided through ESRI’s owns services, or, longer term, hosting the various ArcGIS products on the cloud yourself. We saw a great semo of ArcGIS Geoanalytics running a Python Notebook on databricks.</p>
<p>Finally, we had various mentions of ‘digital twins’. I remember the last <a href="https://www.xyht.com/spatial-itgis/geo-business-2019/">GEO Business conference I went to in 2019</a> there was a lot of talk about digital twins, but nobody had actually created and used one. Now, a number of people have. One example was a model of buildings in London including information on how much water might be needed by the fire brigade to extinguish a blaze in a specific building and whether the water supply network could supply the needed amount of water. A few people weren’t convinced these were digital twins – as the key definition of a digital twin is that it includes real time updates. However, ‘real-time’ depends a bit on what temporal scale you are working to – and the amount of water needed to extinguish a blaze in a specific building probably wouldn’t change that much – so I think this is very case dependent.</p>
<p>GEO Business 2022 at ExCeL, London I also attended the GEO Business conference out at ExCeL on the following day. Again, this was a great networking opportunity, although with a slightly different subset of the geospatial community. I went to a couple of very interesting applications talks – including one from the Met Office by Anthony Veal, who was working on a pilot project to increase the rated capacity of overhead electricity lines depending on the weather. Currently, overhead lines are rated for their maximum capacity based on a worse case weather scenario, which is rarely reached. Heat is the main limiting factor on the lines, with wind being the primary mitigating factor. This project is working on moving from a static worst case scenario limit to dynamic limits based on the current wind conditions. It is still in relatively early stages, with one case study, but shows a potentially significant increase in capacity at certain times. This, arguably, could be considered a digital twin with its’ real time data but the Met Office didn’t use this term.</p>

</div>
<p>Doug Specht also gave an excellent talk on Teaching Geospatial Ethics, and how he approaches this with his audience of students who are not geographers, but are often asked to create maps. He summarised the issues as a very nice three principles:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>No visualisation is neutral</p></li>
<li><p>Platforms have politics</p></li>
<li><p>All perspectives are partial</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This works very well for this students – journalists, writers and communication – and works as a great first step before looking at geospatial ethics frameworks like the <a href="https://ethicalgeo.org/locus-charter/">Locus Charter</a>.</p>
<p>Cloud processing also cropped up a lot at GEO Business, with many of the companies, large and small, offering new cloud based services for working with LiDAR point clouds, aerial photos and drones. There was also a nice expansion of engaging others with GIS and highlight how useful it can be across all professions – something I strongly believe in and see every day.</p>
<p>Overall it was a great couple of days, with lots to think about.

  <title>Spatial R – Time to move from sp to sf</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2022-02-spatial-r/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It was about three years ago (2019) when I last wrote about the <a href="http://www.geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk/spatial-r-moving-from-sp-to-sf/">sp and sf libraries in R</a>. The R Spatial world has moved on since then, with sp heading close to retirement now. Since 2019 I have run Introduction to Spatial Data &amp; Using R as a GIS, and its companion course, Confident Spatial Analysis and Statistics in R &amp; GeoDa, around 12 times teaching over 150 students. At some point I needed to make the transition from sp to sf – the question was, when?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>Students at work, learning how to use R as a GIS A quick recap before we get into the details – there are two main libraries that allow us to handle spatial data in R – sp and sf. sp has been around for nearly 20 years now (it first came out in 2005) and is now entering retirement. sf is much newer – it initially came out in 2016, and ever since has been gaining new functions and new users.</p>
<p>sp and sf work in fundamentally different ways, specifically revolving around how they store spatial data within R. sp uses something called S4 classes, where the different elements of spatial data (coordinates/geometry, attribute table, coordinate system, etc.) are split up into different ‘slots’ and accessed using the @ symbol. sf uses S3 classes and stores spatial data all within a standard data frame, with some extra header information and a geometry column.</p>

</div>
<p>The practical upshot of all of this is that I have to choose which one to teach in my courses. Pre 2019, I taught everything in sp because that was the most well used library. In March 2019 (three years ago) I moved the first part of my course from sp to sf and introduced the tmap library. This actually made R much easier to teach – because it was quicker and easier to create a map, primarily as a result of the great tmap library and the simplicity that using sf brought.</p>
<p>At this point sf was still developing, and I struggled to be able to do a point-in-polygon analysis in sf – see my <a href="http://www.geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk/spatial-r-moving-from-sp-to-sf/">previous blog post</a> for more details! Additionally, there were still many many examples of sp code on the web, and relatively few sf examples. Therefore I decided to keep my more advanced practical 3: point in polygon analysis in sp.</p>
<p>By the time we got to Dec 2021 (last year) sf had come along way since 2019, and point in polygon analysis was now possible – so I updated my <a href="https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis/commit/de56e5df9bee67c25c468eeb74b63ae132a0f9f9">practical to reflect this</a>. I’ve still kept the sp example, and in the introductory course I still mention sp in passing as I think it is important for any R spatial users to be aware of sp, even if they don’t actually use it. This is because I think for at least the next couple of years, there will be lots of sp examples still on Stack Exchange and elsewhere on the web, and when people find these examples, they need to be able to understand what they are any why they are different.</p>
<p>Moving forward from now (2022) most of the packages that support sp (rgdal, rgeos, maptools) are being retired from the end of 2023, and everyone is being advised to move to sf. sp itself is still getting some maintenance updates, but this will only be for a limited period of time, and now everyone should be moving from sp to sf for new work. In addition, if you work with raster data, the raster library (which has many of the same dependents as sp) is transitioning to terra.</p>
<p>The We Are R Ladies group on Twitter did a very good Twitter thread about these changes – do check it out at <a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies/status/1469286521874300939" class="uri">https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies/status/1469286521874300939</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickbearman.github.io/blog/2022-02-spatial-r/twitter.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>My introductory course is now fully transitioned to sf, and the practical is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license at <a href="https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis" class="uri">https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis</a>. I will next be running this course as part of the <a href="https://nickbearman.github.io/training-courses.html">GeoIgnite conference in Canada, on 9th March</a>. I will also be running this course again the future, please sign up to my mailing list to find out when I have confirmed more dates.</p>
<p>Next on the list is updating the Advanced course, Confident Spatial Analysis and Statistics in R &amp; GeoDa and moving this from sp to sf, which is going to be quite a job. A summer project, perhaps….!</p>

  <title>Matrix: What’s it all about?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve recently come across a new piece of software that could revolutionise communication – and yes, you have probably heard that before, in many articles on the Internet! However this one might actually be useful (although maybe not revolutionary yet), and be a significant improvement on the many different systems we have for instant messaging (IM). At the last count I regularly use Teams, Slack, WhatsApp and Signal and also sometimes use texts, Skype, Facebook Messenger, Telegram for IM, and there are probably some others I have forgotten as well.</p>
<p>This is really helpful, to avoid situations like <a href="https://xkcd.com/1810/">this</a>:</p>

<figcaption>XKCD explaining why a system like Matrix is important</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Matrix is something that might be able to replace all of these, and bring them into one interface, so you can have all of your IM communication in one piece of software. Matrix is an open source, distributed protocol for instant message communication. It’s a bit like email, but for IM. The email analogy works really well – because Matrix is the protocol (like email) and you can get many different clients, like you can for email (Outlook, Thunderbird, Gmail, …). You also have a Matrix address, much like an email address.</p>
<p>Within Matrix you also can have specific chat rooms (think like Slack Channels, IRC rooms, Teams teams, etc.) as well as 1 to 1 messaging. The big advantages for me are that it is open source (the only open source option for this, I believe) as well as being end-to-end encrypted. It also has bridges which allow you to join in other platforms from your Matrix account, and this is the big thing for me. Now when people send me messages in WhatsApp, Signal, Teams, Slack or anywhere else, I can a) actually find their message easily when I hear a sound and b) reply to it all in one place!</p>
<p>The other key bit of the puzzle is the client. I use a program called Element, which is one of the main clients for Matrix. There are <a href="https://matrix.org/clients/">others</a> available as well, and you can use whichever one you like. You can also switch between platforms and all your messages and rooms you have joined will still be there.</p>
<p>This is my Matrix address: <span class="citation" data-cites="nick:nickbearman.ems.host">@nick:nickbearman.ems.host</span> and if you go to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nick:nickbearman.ems.host">https://matrix.to/#/#nick:nickbearman.ems.host</a> in your web browser, this will open up the (Matrix) client of your choice (Element by default), give you the option of signing up for an account on Matrix and then allow you to send me an instant message.</p>
<p>You can also join rooms in a similar manner, e.g.&nbsp;the recently created OSGeoUK chat room on Matrix, to discuss Open Source Geo things: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org">https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org</a>. If you are in to open source Geo, please join us there!</p>
<p>There are also lots of other resources including Matrix’s <a href="https://matrix.org/faq/">FAQ page</a>, this post explaining <a href="https://blog.ergaster.org/post/20210602-matrix-for-im/">what Matrix is</a>, and this much longer post discussing <a href="https://ansible.github.io/community/posts/matrix_and_ansible.html">how Matrix could be really useful in open source software development,</a> and some background info on IRC too.</p>
<p>Matrix also updated the XKCD comic above with their current bridges, so you can talk to all of these through Matrix!</p>
<p>Give it a go and let me know how you get on!</p>
<p>*For bridging to other environments, you need admin access in Teams / Slack to set this up, which requires the organisation who admins the system to allow you to use the bridges on their system!</p>

  <title>To video, or not to video</title>
  <dc:creator>Nick Bearman</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>“That is the question.”</p>
<p><em>(Apologies to anyone who has studied English Literature, at any level!)</em></p>
<p>With nearly everyone participating in more and move video calls, “to share video or not to share video” is, indeed, the question. When participating in an online conference, should the audience members share their video?</p>
<p>We have all attended loads of video conferencing calls over the last 15 months, and I’ve been no expectation to this. I attended two conferences recently, and one thing that struck me was whether the audience members have their cameras on.</p>
<p>When I’m running a training course or presenting, I really love to be able to see people’s faces – so I can see who I am talking to. Of course, I realise this isn’t always possible or something the participants want to do (either because of bandwidth limitations, not having a suitable home environment [although this is less of an issue with virtual backgrounds now] or many other reasons). Therefore when I am running a course I explicitly say at the beginning:</p>
<p><em>“If you can have your video on and would like to, please do. I really like to be able to see people. However if you have limited bandwidth, or another reason why you don’t want to share your video, that is fine as well.”</em></p>
<p>With this approach 9 out of 10 people usually put their video on and it makes it a much better experience for me (and, I think for them).</p>

<p>I recently attended two conferences (<a href="https://agile-gi.eu/past-conferences/agile-conferences/agile-2021-virtual">AGILE 2021</a> and <a href="https://codingedi.github.io/">Coding in the Open</a>), where only the people presenting shared their video, and the attendees did not. There have been many conferences like this, and at some conferences attendees do not have a choice (e.g.&nbsp;if you are using Zoom Webinar, the audience can not share their video).</p>
<p>However for these conferences, there was a choice (AGILE used a standard <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> room, and Coding in the Open used <a href="https://bluejeans.com/">Bluejeans</a>). For AGILE, the organisers asked participants to turn on their cameras for a group photo! About two-thirds or so of people did turn their cameras on the for <a href="https://agile2021.senselab.tuc.gr/social-events/">photo</a>. However as soon as the photo was done, people turned their cameras off again.</p>

</div>
<p>There seems to be an unwritten rule that the audience have their cameras off, and I have seen this is many other conferences as well.</p>

<figcaption>The blank boxes (with names and initials removed)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Personally, I don’t really like this, as all you get to see of the other people on the call are black boxes. Yes, you can turn off the blank boxes, but if I am presenting, I like to be able to see who I am presenting to, and if I am in the audience, I also like to see who the audience are.</p>
<p>The other conference I attended was Coding in the Open, and this was run on <a href="https://www.bluejeans.com/">Bluejeans</a>. Here the attendees were asked to turn of their video because of bandwidth. This is often a worrying concern, and here around 150 had signed up for the free conference, and the organisers were very worried that 150 people joining the call with video might stretch the limits of the platform. In the end, typically we had 40-50 people in each session, so wouldn’t have been an issue.</p>
<p>This is a very common concern for organisers, and compounded by the fact that for free events, often only one third or one half of the people who sign up actually appear. The question then is how much capacity do you need for this event, with additional capacity often costing more money. This is a discussion for another time though.</p>
<p>I did a rough show of hands in the session, and it seems most people would prefer to see the audience, whether they are in the audience or the presenter. Additionally, most programs have the option of hiding the video of other participants, if that is what you prefer.</p>
<p>As an aside, it is worth mentioning that you can turn your own video off in most platforms, and apparently this has been shown to reduce tiredness. I’m not sure it makes a lot of different for me, but for some people it clearly does:</p>
<p><em>Now that you can remove the icon video of yourself in Google Meet I am finding online meetings far less stressful. Seeing myself (however small on the screen) for the last 15 months has been horrible. I am happy to have my video on + be seen, but not as a mirror back onto myself</em> <br> <em>— prof jenny pickerill (<span class="citation" data-cites="JennyPickerill">@JennyPickerill</span>) June 9, 2021</em></p>
<p>So if you think it might help you, give it a try!</p>
<p>I guess as we work out what the ‘new normal’ is, we will be creating new social rules and expectations for how we work, including in video calls. I would say please do share your video if you can – whether you are in a call of 2, class of 25 or lecture hall of 200. I think it makes all the difference to the person presenting!</p>
<p>Do share your experiences in the comments below and let me know what you think.</p>

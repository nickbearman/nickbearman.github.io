    "section": "",
    "text": "Last week I attended the first ESRI UK Annual Conference (17th May) and the first GEO Business conference (18th & 19th May) for three years (although GEO Business had a conference last autumn, which I didn’t manage to attend). It was great to be back at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre for the ESRI UK Annual Conference – it is always a great opportunity to meet colleagues working in GIS in the UK across all industries. Clearly open source didn’t feature that much (!) but all of the ESRI tools were showcased and it was a great opportunity to see what is coming up over the next year.\n\n\n\nESRI UK Annual Conference at QEII Centre, Westminster, London\n\n\nESRI UK Annual Conference at QEII Centre, Westminster, London Sustainability was the key theme of the conference, “GIS – Creating a Sustainable Future”, with the Met Office delivering the keynote focusing on climate change. I actually missed their presentation (a long train journey!) but hearing from other participants it sounded a good presentation, although there was the question of how we turn talk about climate change at the conference into action that makes a real difference in the world.\nESRI were very keen to push the ArcGIS Suite as a set of capabilities and focusing on what you can do with their tools, rather than the tools themselves. Highlights include new graph data structures now available in ArcGIS Pro, the versatility of LiDAR data and ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online, ESRI’s response to Google Earth Engine allowing processing of large satellite data in the cloud. On that note, ArcGIS Online was first launched ten years ago – which was a slight shock to many attendees! It has gone from strength to strength – and I do like how the ArcGIS products have made GIS more accessible to new users.\nArcGIS Hub also featured prominaty as a way of collating information and making it avaialbe to non-GIS users. We also heard about deep learning models being features in the Living Atlas, real time vechicle tracking (although interestingly no mention of ethics), and greater links with AutoDesk billed as ArcGIS GeoBIM. ESRI are also very keen on pushing greater use of the cloud – either provided through ESRI’s owns services, or, longer term, hosting the various ArcGIS products on the cloud yourself. We saw a great semo of ArcGIS Geoanalytics running a Python Notebook on databricks.\nFinally, we had various mentions of ‘digital twins’. I remember the last GEO Business conference I went to in 2019 there was a lot of talk about digital twins, but nobody had actually created and used one. Now, a number of people have. One example was a model of buildings in London including information on how much water might be needed by the fire brigade to extinguish a blaze in a specific building and whether the water supply network could supply the needed amount of water. A few people weren’t convinced these were digital twins – as the key definition of a digital twin is that it includes real time updates. However, ‘real-time’ depends a bit on what temporal scale you are working to – and the amount of water needed to extinguish a blaze in a specific building probably wouldn’t change that much – so I think this is very case dependent.\nGEO Business 2022 at ExCeL, London I also attended the GEO Business conference out at ExCeL on the following day. Again, this was a great networking opportunity, although with a slightly different subset of the geospatial community. I went to a couple of very interesting applications talks – including one from the Met Office by Anthony Veal, who was working on a pilot project to increase the rated capacity of overhead electricity lines depending on the weather. Currently, overhead lines are rated for their maximum capacity based on a worse case weather scenario, which is rarely reached. Heat is the main limiting factor on the lines, with wind being the primary mitigating factor. This project is working on moving from a static worst case scenario limit to dynamic limits based on the current wind conditions. It is still in relatively early stages, with one case study, but shows a potentially significant increase in capacity at certain times. This, arguably, could be considered a digital twin with its’ real time data but the Met Office didn’t use this term.\n\n\n\nGEO Business 2022 at ExCeL, London\n\n\nDoug Specht also gave an excellent talk on Teaching Geospatial Ethics, and how he approaches this with his audience of students who are not geographers, but are often asked to create maps. He summarised the issues as a very nice three principles:\n\nNo visualisation is neutral\nPlatforms have politics\nAll perspectives are partial\n\nThis works very well for this students – journalists, writers and communication – and works as a great first step before looking at geospatial ethics frameworks like the Locus Charter.\nCloud processing also cropped up a lot at GEO Business, with many of the companies, large and small, offering new cloud based services for working with LiDAR point clouds, aerial photos and drones. There was also a nice expansion of engaging others with GIS and highlight how useful it can be across all professions – something I strongly believe in and see every day.\nOverall it was a great couple of days, with lots to think about.

    "title": "FOSS4G: Travelling by Train to Florence, Italy (from Weymouth, UK)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently attended my first international FOSS4G conference in Florence (Firenze), Italy, in August 2022. For those who don’t know, FOSS4G is Free and Open Source for (4) Geospatial, so all of the people involved in open source geospatial software (e.g. QGIS, R-Spatial, Geoserver, Mapserver, GRASS, etc. etc.) get together. It is a great opportunity to meet up with the community, get to know people who you might only have met online, and find out about the latest developments. There are some great write-ups online about the conference – check them out.\nI decided to travel from the UK by train to Florence, and this post is about that journey – in both senses of booking it, and travelling it. I wanted to do this a) to see if it was possible and how easy it was, and b) to reduce my carbon footprint by getting the train rather than flying. I’ve also got some photos of my trip on Twitter.\nThe first place to spend a bit of time is seat61.com – this is a great website run by Mark Smith who does all sorts of train travel across the world. My trip to Florence is bit a tame compared to some of the trips on there, but it was a great resource. Seat61 directed me to Rail Europe, where I booked all of my trains beyond Paris. Working out the timings was a little complex, but with the help of suggested routes, I got something worked out.\n\nMy planned outbound itinerary was:\n\nWeymouth – London – Paris – Geneva\nnight in Geneva\nGeneva – Milan – Florence\n\nReturn:\n\nFlorence – Turin\nnight in Turin\nTurin – Paris – London – Weymouth\n\nI booked these about ~2 months beforehand (in June), and the cost breakdown was:\n\nWeymouth to London (SWR, return): £70\nLondon to Paris (Eurostar, return): £219\n\nRail Europe (out):\n\nParis to Geneva (SNCF, single): €129 ~£112.91\n(night in Geneva CHF90, ~£80.90)\nGeneva – Milan (Trenitalia): €60 ~£52.52\nMilan – Florence (Trenitalia): €39.90 ~£34.92\n\nReturn:\n\nFlorence – Turin: €50 ~£44.50\nTurin – Paris (TGV): €99 ~£86.65\nParis – London (included in return above)\nLondon – Weymouth (included in return above)\n\nBecause of the currency changes, I paid £341.95 to Rail Europe, so a total of £630.95 for my train travel.\nOne alternative I didn’t manage to find was sleeper trains. Night jet has recently gained in popularity since I booked this, so there might be some alternative routes there.\nThere is now an overnight option to Venice, but this wasn’t an option when I started looking, and Venice is a bit out of the way to get to Florence.\nMy planned itinerary got slightly mangled because of the rail strikes in the UK, so I ended up having to travel from Exeter to London (rather than Weymouth) and have a extra night stay in London – but I managed to catch the ‘Back to the Future’ musical, so the extra night had some compensations.\nBeyond that, everything went as planned and I arrived in Florence on time, at 1400 on Monday.\nThe SCNF Connect app – the equivalent of the National Rail app for France & Italy. One thing to remember – when travelling on Eurostar, the queue at St Pancras was very very long, but they were very efficient so even though there were many people there, I had plenty of time for my train – I arrived and got through the queue, check-in, security and both sets of border control (leaving UK and entering France) in 45 min.\n\nI’d also recommend the SCNF Connect app – a great app which will give you train details with updates and platforms.\nCheck out the Twitter thread for some photos of the various different trains I was on.\nIt was a great trip, and I really enjoyed it. It certainly took longer and cost more, but for me, it was worthwhile. Let me know about your train adventures!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "On PostGIS day last week, Thurs 17th Nov, we ran FOSS4G:UK Local 2022. We were trying out a new model, with the conference distributed over 9 different physical venues (and online). I chaired three amazing keynotes, which were streamed to all the venues and on the internet. We then had 38 local presentations across the nine venues, with most of them streamed and recorded.\n\nOverall the day went really well, and we had some great feedback from participants and presenters. One great aspect was once the presentations were completed, they were available on YouTube more or less instantly.\nWe had 246 people attending in person, and I think reached about another 50 online. Anyone could watch the streams online so it’s tricky to know exactly, but the first keynote had about 100 views as it finished, so assuming some double counting (people in the rooms who were on the YouTube stream) I think we can say we reached about 300 people. This is much greater than our usual in person conferences so I’m pleased to say we managed to increase our reach and get more people involved in FOSS4G:UK.\n\n\n\n(Some of) the local venues, including Keyworth, Glasgow, Leeds, London, Cardiff and Southampton (we also had Bovey Tracy, Bristol and Manchester, not shown)\n\n\nOur multi venue streaming didn’t quite work out as planned initially – our first session had some technical problems so a number of the talks didn’t stream. But everyone was very forgiving, so thanks to all the good will in the community.\nFor the keynotes, we had a Jitsi meeting which each of the venues and presentors joined. We could then share cameras as usual in a video conferencing meeting, and it was great to see all of the venues share their cameras in the welcome section:\nThe Jitsi call was then streamed to YouTube. We then collated questions via the YouTube chat and the Matrix room we had running. Theoretically we people could have asked questions in the room (relayed via the Admin WhatsApp group we were running) but it was easier for people to type directly in the Matrix room or YouTube chat, even if they were physically in the room. See this post (coming soon, I will circulate to the OSGeo:UK mailing list when published) for some more technical details, and lessons learned.\nWe’re very much looking forward to the next one, and I hope you can be involved – join the OSGeo:UK mailing list to stay up to date."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Along with many other people from the geospatial community, I was up in London earlier this week for ESRI UK Annual Conference, GeoBusiness and Spatial Data Science Conference. It was a great couple of days, and while I didn’t manage to attend everything (limited time, money and energy!) it was great to see and hear what I did.\nESRI UK’s Annual Conference had a couple fewer streams than usual, but it was still as busy. I also managed to get into one of the over subscribed training sessions, to see what had changed in ArcGIS Online recently. Digital twins were mentioned quite a bit, developing from my blog post about last year’s conference, and the vocabulary is evolving and the focus has now shifted to how they are actually useful.\nJurassic Fibre gave a great presentation about how their as-built survey validation process made use of in field tools to collect and verify data. They were comparing what was planned to be built against what was actually built, and had some great processes for managing this. It really shows not just how important data is, but also how important how linking different teams together is important to deliver a service.\n\n\n\nDiscussions and catching-up at ESRI UK annual conference\n\n\nDiscussions and catching-up at ESRI UK annual conference I also had some really useful discussions about sharing data between platforms – some people use ArcGIS, some use QGIS, some R, and so on. Everyone has good reasons for using the software they do, and it would be a hard struggle to get everyone (in a team, group or even organisation) to use the same software – and more often that not will be a waste of time. What can be done is to help everyone make use of the same data, and / or share data in exchangeable formats.\nAccessibility also had a focus in the end keynote presentation, combined with ChatGPT. Large language models create great potential for interacting with maps and spatial data in a different way – a prototype demo showed how a user could verbally ask for information about a map, and the computer could give a verbal summary. No where near production yet, but it shows what could happen. There is a huge amount of potential here – with developing better interfaces for those suffering from visual impairment – or for better natural language interaction with maps. This linked a bit in with my PhD work, from 2008-2011, focusing on sonification, where I used sound to represent data in combination with vision. There are some videos and code demonstrating this (I’m sure the VBA code in ArcMap will no longer work, not the Google Maps API code, but the videos how how it worked!), as well as my PhD thesis itself.\nhttps://vimeo.com/22290435\nSonification – from a few years ago 😉\nWill ChatGPT replace GIS Analysts? I don’t think so, so we will all still have jobs! It will certainly change what we can do, and some jobs will change. With any LLM, you need to know how to ask the right question as well as being able to understand the answer that comes back. Ultimately the skills will be in interpreting the results, and making a judgement call about whether it is useful or not. Google revolutionised the internet when it was launched – and LLMs will be no different. As ever, we always need to be critical of maps and spatial analysis output – and ChatGPT or Bard or any other LLM will not change that. If anything, it will make it more important!\n\n“So don’t just use GIS, but use it critically.”\n\nI also popped into the Spatial Data Science Conference party in Wednesday night, and it sounds like the conference was fantastic – next time perhaps!\nGeoBusiness followed ESRI AC UK, with a huge range of geo related businesses hosting stands and presenting talks. The stands were very equipment focused, with many new drones and surveying tool available to have a look at and discuss. However I was more interested in the talks and networking opportunities. The skills shortage was again raised as an issue, with not enough people available with geospatial skills. However speaking with those at the coal faces, new graduate with geospatial skills are being tempted away with starting salaries of £5k – £10k more for similar roles outside geospatial (e.g. programming) and even more for data science roles. It’s a hard ask for someone to give up £5k – £10k a year to stay in geospatial!\n\nDeveloping skills of people coming into geospatial is something that is of particular interest to me, with a range of initiatives around training and skills development. While many users are big ESRI clients, there is certainly an increase in people wanting to use ESRI along side open source solutions – particularly QGIS. I see lots of potential for North Road’s SLYR tool, what they term: the ESRI to QGIS Compatibility Suite.\nThere are so many novel applications of GI data and one in particular caught my eye – ClearSky, a product from Aspia Space, have created a AI algorithm which converts uses cloud-penetrating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to create cloudless multispectral imaging, right across the visible and short-wave infrared spectrum. This allows a ‘cloud-free’ view of satellite imagery – an interesting and valuable resource.\nA different, but potentially equally useful application of GIS data was presented by Christopher Jackson from Advanced Infrastructure talking about geospatial tools for energy. They have created an application to help local councils estimate where it may be viable to install electric car charging points. The GIS analysis itself is not that ground breaking, as they are looking at a combination of IMD data, street width and electricity supply provision data to estimate feasibility and cost of electric car charging point installation – but the fact they think this is worth building into a product that can be sold is. It shows how vital geospatial data is and reminds me of the fact that there are still many people out there who don’t know what geospatial is. Communicating this is one thing we could all do better at.\nIt was great to see so many people, and chat about upcoming projects and opportunities, including FOSS4G:UK 2023 – watch this space(s) for more details soon: OSGeo:UK!"

    "text": "A couple of weeks ago I spent a fantastic week in Cape Town, South Africa, attending the 2023 International Cartographic Conference. The ICC (not to be confused with the International Cricket Council!) is held every two years by the International Cartographic Association (ICA). It’s a global conference, and this is the second time it has taken place in South Africa, previously being hosted in Durban in 2003.\nThe conference covers everything under the umbrella of Cartography and GIScience, with papers ranging from user assessments to theoretical discussions, covering topics as wide as cartographic methods, generalisation, COVID, navigation, education, spatial data infrastructures and many many other topics. There is plenty of overlap with the Cartography and Geographic Information Science journal (CaGIS Journal) and a number of us from the academic board were attending to present our work, connect with authors and discover new articles. I work as Cartographic Editor for CaGIS, and it was great to see some published work presented, and discover new authors who might write for the journal."

Jakub Wabiński developed a 3D printed tactile model which has been published in CaGIS and Jan Brus and Radek Barvir presented a process to 3D print models with conductive elements so users can press on certain locations which then prompts a mobile phone to play a verbal recording describing that feature.\n\nThe 3D model uses conductive strips to link the touch on designated areas of the 3D model to the tablet underneath, which then pays the relevant audio narration. This allows many different relatively cheap 3D printed models to be used with one tablet."

    "section": "UN Acronym Soup",
    "text": "UN Acronym Soup\nThe ICA is quite a large organisation with a long history, and has good links with a number of United Nations (UN) groups and initiatives, including UN GGIM - UN Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management and UN IGIF - Integrated Geospatial Information Framework. The IGIF is a multidimensional framework that provides countries with a basis for developing, integrating, strengthening, and benefiting from geospatial information management. There is a risk of drowning in acronym soup when it comes to working with the UN, and I had some great discussions when asking a number of people how UN groups and initiatives like GGIM or IGIF have made an impact in the real world. I had a range of different answers, from ‘I have no idea!’ to ‘having these programmes is better than nothing, so they probably have some impact’ to some much more detailed responses (see below).\nTo me, it was certainly clear that the UN could do a better job of explaining what it is doing in the area of geospatial in a way that can be easily understood. However, there are some great outputs from a variety of UN departments. Firstly, there are the Sustainable Development Goals, which is probably one of their most well known activities:\n\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals are often illustrated using this image, or a variation of it. Originally from https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/12/sustainable-development-goals-kick-off-with-start-of-new-year/.\nThese are something many people have heard of, and provide a series of targets to help all countries develop sustainably. Many others can describe them better than I can (see the UN, Concern), one of the keynote presentations at the conference from Greg Scott and even Google)) but one striking image is the discussion of how to measure the progress in achieving these goals, and the fact that for a number of the goals some countries are actually going backwards. Managing the data for these is a key issue, and a number of goals are quite difficult to measure, with some countries not having the data to be able to measure the progress (or lack thereof). It is possible that in comes cases this may be deliberate (for example, China reducing the number of statistics they publish because they were showing a bad message) but I think in most of the cases it is because a) the goals are tricky to measure and b) they often require specific resources which may not be available.\nReturning to UN GGIM & IGIF, accessibility of data is one of the key focus areas of the UN GGIM. One of their core aims is helping all countries develop their spatial data infrastructures, that is the national organisations that manage, maintain and make accessible their spatial data. The UN IGIF is a framework that will help countries in this process - highlighting best practice and examples of how to do this. Of course every country is at a different stage in the process, but from discussions at the ICC, every country is keen to progress their work.\nGobe Hobona from the OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) gave me a very good explanation of IGIF, which formed part of the description above. He also compared it to INSPIRE, which is the European Union (EU) initiative on spatial data infrastructure, and is probably 10-15 years ahead of IGIF. INSPIRE has provided a framework for structuring spatial data and metadata across the EU, and therefore making data (including spatial data) much more accessible by providing information about it in a structured way. Similar initiatives exist in the UK, for example on the data.gov.uk site - you can search for many different UK government related data sets there, and one of the key underpinning structures is Gemini which makes this possible. More specifically, the Gemini standard is a profile of the ISO 19115 standard that facilitates conformance to INSPIRE metadata implementing rules. A common thread across many of the geospatial data initiatives and frameworks is that they make use of OGC Standards."

    "text": "Mapping for a Sustainable World\nAnother great output from the UN is Mapping for a Sustainable World, which is a fantastic publication from a collaboration from the UN and the ICA (ICC). It’s a free book, available as a PDF, covering two main aims. Firstly, it discusses how maps can be used to help monitor progress across all (13) sustainable development goals, for example Goal 5: Gender Equality.\n\nAs example of applying spatial data to the Sustainable Development Goals. Page 54 & 55 from Mapping for a Sustainable World.\nAs well as discussing the availability of spatial data, it also covers practically every key aspect of working with spatial data and GIS (projections, MAUP, classification, scale, generalisation, colour, typography and so on), it also gives examples of 14 different types of map (thematic, nominal, choropleth, etc.) and discusses different environments for map use (both in terms of audience and medium).\nI was fortunate enough to meet one of the co authors, Britta Ricker, at the CaGIS reception, and heard about some of the challenges in pulling this book together, including methods that are not well known, but potentially very useful (e.g. dasymetric mapping), and UN’s approach to boundaries (e.g how to show disputed areas such as Tiwain, Crimea, Israel/Palestine, etc.). This is a well known geographical issue, as discussed shown in MapTiler, Google, Apple Maps, and even as discussed by James Cheshire on Christmas decorations! The UN also has a standard detailing these issues, as well as maps people can use themselves, including official UN boundaries in their web maps.\nThey had some print copies available in English and French at the conference, and both can be downloaded as PDFs for free from https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826?ln=en0.\nAs well as seeing a wide range of presentations across the whole range of Cartography and GIScience (let me know if you’re interested in publishing in CaGIS!), it was great to meet and network with a whole range of people passionate about cartography and GIScience from around the world. This conference also included a record proportion of attendees from both the African continent (450 and South Africa itself (385), which was fantastic to see (stats from map of attendee home country on https://icc2023.org/). A number of those I spoke to said they would be unable to attend if the conference was outside Africa due to funding restrictions, so it was great for them to have this opportunity."

    "title": "Spatial R – Time to move from sp to sf",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It was about three years ago (2019) when I last wrote about the sp and sf libraries in R. The R Spatial world has moved on since then, with sp heading close to retirement now. Since 2019 I have run Introduction to Spatial Data & Using R as a GIS, and its companion course, Confident Spatial Analysis and Statistics in R & GeoDa, around 12 times teaching over 150 students. At some point I needed to make the transition from sp to sf – the question was, when?\n\n\n\nStudents at work, learning how to use R as a GIS\n\n\nStudents at work, learning how to use R as a GIS A quick recap before we get into the details – there are two main libraries that allow us to handle spatial data in R – sp and sf. sp has been around for nearly 20 years now (it first came out in 2005) and is now entering retirement. sf is much newer – it initially came out in 2016, and ever since has been gaining new functions and new users.\nsp and sf work in fundamentally different ways, specifically revolving around how they store spatial data within R. sp uses something called S4 classes, where the different elements of spatial data (coordinates/geometry, attribute table, coordinate system, etc.) are split up into different ‘slots’ and accessed using the @ symbol. sf uses S3 classes and stores spatial data all within a standard data frame, with some extra header information and a geometry column.\n\n\n\nA great table summarising the differences between sp and sf, from WeAreRLadies on Twitter.\n\n\nThe practical upshot of all of this is that I have to choose which one to teach in my courses. Pre 2019, I taught everything in sp because that was the most well used library. In March 2019 (three years ago) I moved the first part of my course from sp to sf and introduced the tmap library. This actually made R much easier to teach – because it was quicker and easier to create a map, primarily as a result of the great tmap library and the simplicity that using sf brought.\nAt this point sf was still developing, and I struggled to be able to do a point-in-polygon analysis in sf – see my previous blog post for more details! Additionally, there were still many many examples of sp code on the web, and relatively few sf examples. Therefore I decided to keep my more advanced practical 3: point in polygon analysis in sp.\nBy the time we got to Dec 2021 (last year) sf had come along way since 2019, and point in polygon analysis was now possible – so I updated my practical to reflect this. I’ve still kept the sp example, and in the introductory course I still mention sp in passing as I think it is important for any R spatial users to be aware of sp, even if they don’t actually use it. This is because I think for at least the next couple of years, there will be lots of sp examples still on Stack Exchange and elsewhere on the web, and when people find these examples, they need to be able to understand what they are any why they are different.\nMoving forward from now (2022) most of the packages that support sp (rgdal, rgeos, maptools) are being retired from the end of 2023, and everyone is being advised to move to sf. sp itself is still getting some maintenance updates, but this will only be for a limited period of time, and now everyone should be moving from sp to sf for new work. In addition, if you work with raster data, the raster library (which has many of the same dependents as sp) is transitioning to terra.\nThe We Are R Ladies group on Twitter did a very good Twitter thread about these changes – do check it out at https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies/status/1469286521874300939.\n\nMy introductory course is now fully transitioned to sf, and the practical is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license at https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis. I will next be running this course as part of the GeoIgnite conference in Canada, on 9th March. I will also be running this course again the future, please sign up to my mailing list to find out when I have confirmed more dates.\nNext on the list is updating the Advanced course, Confident Spatial Analysis and Statistics in R & GeoDa and moving this from sp to sf, which is going to be quite a job. A summer project, perhaps….!"

Please contact me to have a chat about your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Nick is a great teacher, and I would recommend his excellent service.”\nDamian Rudge, MPhil Research Student, Newcastle University\n\n\n\n\nDamian Rudge\n“I am a life-long learner, in my sixties completing a MPhil in archaeology at Newcastle University: this means that when GPS was declassified in the early 2000’s, I was only just staring to use computers. The landscape archaeology which I am researching requires a repertoire of map-making skills.\nI recently completed a 1-to-1 online QGIS mapping course with Nick Bearman. I was guided through the learning process which resulted in the production of three excellent bespoke maps for my thesis. The sessions were recorded which means I can review and replicate what we covered.”\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Portsmouth\n\n\n“Working with Nick has been really great. His classes and consultancy have been extremely professional and instrumental in rapidly upscaling our abilities in both geo-spatial analysis and in the R programming language. We are far more effective now than we were before our engagement with him. Thanks Nick!”\n\n\n\n\nDr Ed Stoddard, Associate Professor in International Security and  Dr Melita Lazell, Principal Lecturer in Global Political Economy and Associate Head (Research),  School of Area Studies, History, Politics and Literature University of Portsmouth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtected Landscapes Partnership\n“Our team organised a bespoke GIS training course with Nick, and it was incredibly helpful. Nick asked us about our experience and what we hoped to use GIS for and designed a bespoke training course to suit our needs. During the training we were able to ask questions and use examples specific to our work area. Nick was able to guide us through a real example of a project we wanted to develop, and teach us how best to go about completing it. Nick’s training has given us all much more confidence to use GIS in our work.” Dr Harriet Knafler, Evidence Coordinator, Protected Landscapes Partnership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Trails UK\n“Nick provided the Team with an introductory GIS session and an advanced training session. The introductory session was a great refresher for members of the team that had GIS experience and a fantastic introduction for those that were new to GIS. The advanced training session was tailored to the teams needs and provided us with a really good understanding of how we can use GIS to pull out our data requirements. Nick provided us all with the confidence to progress and develop our spatial analysis skills and was communicative and engaging throughout. I’d highly recommend working with Nick.”  Jennifer Manning, Policy and Research Officer, National Trails UK\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Westminster\n“The work Nick has carried out has helped us to greatly enhance the way we work with schools. The admissions dashboard he has helped us build allows us to quickly find points of collaboration as well as key demographic and student population data.”  Dr Doug Specht, Senior Lecturer, Director of Teaching and Learning, School of Media and Communication, University of Westminster"

    "text": "I offer a variety of training courses on GIS and spatial data, including introductory and advanced training using QGIS and R. My training is designed to both teach you about GIS itself and how to use the software to do make maps and perform spatial analysis.\n\n\n\n\nMy courses are constantly being developed to take advantage of the latest changes in QGIS and R. Below is a list of the courses coming up, and a link to sign up (where available). If a course does not have a date, then please join my mailing list to hear when new dates are confirmed.\nIf you would like a course run for a group of you, or have any questions, then please do contact me or email nick@nickbearman.com to discuss your needs and get a quote.\n\n\n\n\nIntroductory\nAdvanced\n\n\n\n\nR\nIntroduction to Spatial Data and Using R as a GIS May 2025\nAdvanced R as a GIS: Spatial Analysis and Statistics June 2025\n\n\nQGIS\nIntroduction to QGIS: Understanding and Presenting Spatial Data* April 2025\nConfident Spatial Analysis in QGIS* April 2025\n\n\n\n*often presented together as “Introduction to QGIS: Spatial Data and Spatial Analysis” over 4 half-day sessions. April 2025\n\n\nIntroduction to Spatial Data and Using R as a GIS\n\n\nIn this two half day course we will explore how to use R to import, manage and process spatial data. We will also cover the process of making choropleth maps, as well as some basic spatial analysis. Finally, we will cover the use of loops to make multiple maps quickly and easily, one of the major benefits of using a scripting language to make maps, rather than traditional graphic point-and-click interface. More details.\nNo previous experience of coding is required, although participants would benefit from some experience of using spatial data (e.g. Google Maps).\n\nTue 27th and Wed 28th May 2025, 10am – 1pm (UK/London), online, NCRM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Nice balance of theory and practice. Also useful to learn what to look for if things go wrong. Content was flexible to include what might be useful for our work.”\n\n\n\nVickie, Analyst, Public Health Wales\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced R as a GIS: Spatial Analysis and Statistics\n\n\nIn this two part course we will show you how to prepare and conduct spatial analysis on a variety of spatial data in R, including a range of spatial overlays and data processing techniques. We will also cover how to use GeoDa to perform exploratory spatial data analysis, including making use of linked displays and measures of spatial autocorrelation and clustering. More details.\nThis course can follow-on from the Introduction to Spatial Data & Using R as a GIS course above, or be run independently if participants have some previous knowledge of R / RStudio and spatial data.\nThis course used to be called Confident Spatial Analysis and Statistics in R & GeoDa, and is the same material with a new, better, less wordy name!\n\n\n\n\nTue 3rd and Wed 4th June 2025, 10am – 1pm (UK/London), online.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to QGIS: Spatial Data and Spatial Analysis\nThis course is the Introduction to QGIS and Confident Spatial Analysis in QGIS courses run back to back.\nTue 1st, Wed 2nd, Tue 8th and Wed 9th April 2025, 10am – 1pm (UK/London), online.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to QGIS: Understanding and Presenting Spatial Data\nIn this two part introductory course we will give you an overview on how GIS works, and what we can and can’t do with spatial data. We assume no prior knowledge of GIS and will explain how to get data into the GIS as well as how to produce maps using your own data. More details.\nThis course requires no prior knowledge of GIS or spatial data. A level of basic computer experience is required; such as using websites, Word and saving & moving files.\nAttendees on this course can choose to receive a Certificate of Completion, certified by QGIS for a donation of €20. Geospatial Training Solutions / Nick Bearman is a QGIS approved training organisation, and a donation of €20 for each participant will be made to the QGIS Foundation, supporting the development of QGIS.\nBeing run as Introduction to QGIS: Spatial Data and Spatial Analysis on Tue 1st, Wed 2nd, Tue 8th and Wed 9th April 2025, 10am – 1pm (UK/London), online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I love having a workbook to go through, it’s how I learn best. Also, perfect balance between presentation and practical work.”\n\n\n\nHarriet Ann Patrick, PhD Researcher, University of Sheffield\n\n\n\n\n\nConfident Spatial Analysis in QGIS\nThis intermediate two part course will develop your skills of using spatial data, including collating data from a variety of sources including XY coordinate data and address or postcode based data. We will also cover using spatial overlays, point-in-polygon analysis and spatial joins. More details.\nThis course can follow-on from the Introduction to QGIS course above, or be run independently if the participants have some previous knowledge of QGIS and spatial data.\nAttendees on this course can choose to receive a Certificate of Completion, certified by QGIS for a donation of €20.

    "text": "We finally have an end date for ArcMap! This has been something that has been a long time coming, but I would say is certainly due now. ArcMap final date of support for software updates and patches has been announced as Feb 2024. ESRI launched ArcGIS Pro, the replacement for ArcMap, several years ago and people have been slowly transitioning.\nArcMap holds a special place in my heart because it is the software that I learnt GIS on. I first came across it in my undergraduate Geography degree at University of Leicester in 2003 - introduced to me by a certain Prof. Nick Tate if I remember correctly. This was the first time I had come across the combination of Geography and Computer Science and the subject suited me down to the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater on, I also spent a lot of time working with ArcMap 9.2 (above), which I used in my programming skills to use VBA (Visual Basic Applications) code to create a map that made sounds - an area called sonification, which formed part of my early research interests.\nThings have certainly changed in the 20+ years since 2003. ArcMap itself progressed from version 8.3 all the way up to the now retiring version 10.8.2. Of course we have also seen the rise of open source: QGIS in particular as a competitor to ArcMap, and now potentially better than ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro, depending exactly who you are and what you are trying to-do.\nWe’ve also seen the rise (again) of scripting. With R leading the way and Python a performing a quick catch-up, the combination of easier to use software and ease of access to the benefits of scripting has seen GIS become much more accessible than it was 20 years ago. Some colleagues who have been using GIS longer than I have remember the days of AML, ArcInfo and Sun Microsystems - all of which used command line interfaces to work with data. Much of this was to handle larger data sets than was easy to do in a graphical interface with limited computer resources - much the same situation we see now with big data and bigger computers - but still with limited computer power to process that data.\nI was saddened to hear that some students are still being taught ArcMap:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom https://twitter.com/pokateo_maps/status/1747717333211373896\nFor anyone teaching GIS now, ArcMap is not the tool to teach. It has been a long hard road of transition from ArcMap and I know moving software is not easy, but if anyone is still teaching ArcMap, I very much hope this is its final year. Of course anyone who would like help transitioning, ESRI provide a range of very good materials and I also have good consultancy rates - just get in touch!\nOne constant challenge in the geospatial environment is that the tools and technologies constantly change - and we see this across the board of geospatial. My advice to anyone coming into this area is to at least keep up with the changes and have an idea of what is happening, even if you don’t use the cutting edge in your own work. Much of GIS’s power is in its versatility and you can get 80% of this benefit with only learning 20% of the tools! Also that 20% of knowledge will easily transfer between QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, online web maps and many other GIS.\nI’m really looking forward to the next 20 years, and who knows what it will hold?!\nBest of luck with your GIS work!"

    "text": "My book, GIS: Research Methods, is an introduction to GIS, providing a non-technical overview of the science and tools behind geographic information systems and geographic information science. It is aimed at researchers, students and academics who do not have a GIS or Geography background. The book covers the history of GIS, from John Snow’s Cholera map (1854) right up to today’s software and data and cutting-edge analysis techniques.   It goes on to cover how to find, use and evaluate the latest data sets to critiquing existing maps, highlighting limitations and common mistakes. This is the ideal book for anyone thinking about using GIS in their own research.   You can preview the first chapter here, and there is a short video about the book below.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuying a Copy\nYou can order online from Bloomsbury, with a 35% discount code at the end of the video above, which should give you a total price of £15.29 for the printed book, including UK delivery.\n10/02/2025: I do know Blackwells also currently offer the book for £16.55 including delivery as well, with Amazon currently offering £18.99. If you see it anywhere cheaper, let me know!\n\n\nReviews\nThe Journal of Geography, William Wetherholt\n\n“Nick Bearman provides a thorough introduction to geographic information systems (GIS) for students, researchers, and scholars outside of the geographic discipline.”\n“Some cartographic fundamentals are given quick attention to help social scientists understand what makes a good map, which is a welcome inclusion that can be overlooked in GIS texts.”\n“Anyone with some experience using GIS can sympathize with the sometimes overwhelming variety of files encountered. This text takes time to break down the infrastructure of shapefiles (e.g., .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj) as well as other file types to reduce bewilderment for newcomers.”\n\nWilliam A. Wetherholt (2021) GIS: Research Methods, Journal of Geography, 120:5, 191, DOI: 10.1080/00221341.2021.1951818\nGavin Schrock, GoGeomatics\n\n“If you have ever had the good fortune of attending one of Dr. Bearman’s online classes, or watched any of his instructional videos, his engaging teaching style translates well in this book.”\n“At this point in time, and with the advent of GIS-for-all, if I was to recommend a book, for the beginner/intermediate user seeking to learn more about how GIS can be used in research (from academic to simple project level), GIS Research Methods” by Dr. Nick Bearman, would be it.”\n“While his examples are from social sciences, it is not hard for any end user to see where different methods could be used for their own applications.”\n\nGavin Schrock (2021) Book Review: GIS Research Methods, GoGeomtics, https://gogeomatics.ca/book-gis-research-methods/\n\n\nWhat is GIS?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might see references to a book called ‘What is GIS?’, this is in fact, the same book as GIS: Research Methods. The content is identical! Originally, the title was ‘What is GIS?’, it was a part of Bloomsburys’ ‘What is…?’ series and I rather liked the title. However, just as I had finished writing the book, Bloomsbury decided to rebrand the series, and so now it is GIS: Research Methods."

    "title": "Matrix: What’s it all about?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve recently come across a new piece of software that could revolutionise communication – and yes, you have probably heard that before, in many articles on the Internet! However this one might actually be useful (although maybe not revolutionary yet), and be a significant improvement on the many different systems we have for instant messaging (IM). At the last count I regularly use Teams, Slack, WhatsApp and Signal and also sometimes use texts, Skype, Facebook Messenger, Telegram for IM, and there are probably some others I have forgotten as well.\nThis is really helpful, to avoid situations like this:\n\n\n\nXKCD explaining why a system like Matrix is important\n\n\nMatrix is something that might be able to replace all of these, and bring them into one interface, so you can have all of your IM communication in one piece of software. Matrix is an open source, distributed protocol for instant message communication. It’s a bit like email, but for IM. The email analogy works really well – because Matrix is the protocol (like email) and you can get many different clients, like you can for email (Outlook, Thunderbird, Gmail, …). You also have a Matrix address, much like an email address.\nWithin Matrix you also can have specific chat rooms (think like Slack Channels, IRC rooms, Teams teams, etc.) as well as 1 to 1 messaging. The big advantages for me are that it is open source (the only open source option for this, I believe) as well as being end-to-end encrypted. It also has bridges which allow you to join in other platforms from your Matrix account, and this is the big thing for me. Now when people send me messages in WhatsApp, Signal, Teams, Slack or anywhere else, I can a) actually find their message easily when I hear a sound and b) reply to it all in one place!\nThe other key bit of the puzzle is the client. I use a program called Element, which is one of the main clients for Matrix. There are others available as well, and you can use whichever one you like. You can also switch between platforms and all your messages and rooms you have joined will still be there.\nThis is my Matrix address: @nick:nickbearman.ems.host and if you go to https://matrix.to/#/#nick:nickbearman.ems.host in your web browser, this will open up the (Matrix) client of your choice (Element by default), give you the option of signing up for an account on Matrix and then allow you to send me an instant message.\nYou can also join rooms in a similar manner, e.g. the recently created OSGeoUK chat room on Matrix, to discuss Open Source Geo things: https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org. If you are in to open source Geo, please join us there!\nThere are also lots of other resources including Matrix’s FAQ page, this post explaining what Matrix is, and this much longer post discussing how Matrix could be really useful in open source software development, and some background info on IRC too.\nMatrix also updated the XKCD comic above with their current bridges, so you can talk to all of these through Matrix!\nGive it a go and let me know how you get on!\n*For bridging to other environments, you need admin access in Teams / Slack to set this up, which requires the organisation who admins the system to allow you to use the bridges on their system!"

    "title": "To video, or not to video",
    "section": "",
    "text": "“That is the question.”\n(Apologies to anyone who has studied English Literature, at any level!)\nWith nearly everyone participating in more and move video calls, “to share video or not to share video” is, indeed, the question. When participating in an online conference, should the audience members share their video?\nWe have all attended loads of video conferencing calls over the last 15 months, and I’ve been no expectation to this. I attended two conferences recently, and one thing that struck me was whether the audience members have their cameras on.\nWhen I’m running a training course or presenting, I really love to be able to see people’s faces – so I can see who I am talking to. Of course, I realise this isn’t always possible or something the participants want to do (either because of bandwidth limitations, not having a suitable home environment [although this is less of an issue with virtual backgrounds now] or many other reasons). Therefore when I am running a course I explicitly say at the beginning:\n“If you can have your video on and would like to, please do. I really like to be able to see people. However if you have limited bandwidth, or another reason why you don’t want to share your video, that is fine as well.”\nWith this approach 9 out of 10 people usually put their video on and it makes it a much better experience for me (and, I think for them).\n\n\n\nParticipants in one of my training courses sharing their videos\n\n\nI recently attended two conferences (AGILE 2021 and Coding in the Open), where only the people presenting shared their video, and the attendees did not. There have been many conferences like this, and at some conferences attendees do not have a choice (e.g. if you are using Zoom Webinar, the audience can not share their video).\nHowever for these conferences, there was a choice (AGILE used a standard Zoom room, and Coding in the Open used Bluejeans). For AGILE, the organisers asked participants to turn on their cameras for a group photo! About two-thirds or so of people did turn their cameras on the for photo. However as soon as the photo was done, people turned their cameras off again.\n\n\n\nOur AGILE group photo (1 of 2)\n\n\nThere seems to be an unwritten rule that the audience have their cameras off, and I have seen this is many other conferences as well.\n\n\n\nThe blank boxes (with names and initials removed)\n\n\nPersonally, I don’t really like this, as all you get to see of the other people on the call are black boxes. Yes, you can turn off the blank boxes, but if I am presenting, I like to be able to see who I am presenting to, and if I am in the audience, I also like to see who the audience are.\nThe other conference I attended was Coding in the Open, and this was run on Bluejeans. Here the attendees were asked to turn of their video because of bandwidth. This is often a worrying concern, and here around 150 had signed up for the free conference, and the organisers were very worried that 150 people joining the call with video might stretch the limits of the platform. In the end, typically we had 40-50 people in each session, so wouldn’t have been an issue.\nThis is a very common concern for organisers, and compounded by the fact that for free events, often only one third or one half of the people who sign up actually appear. The question then is how much capacity do you need for this event, with additional capacity often costing more money. This is a discussion for another time though.\nI did a rough show of hands in the session, and it seems most people would prefer to see the audience, whether they are in the audience or the presenter. Additionally, most programs have the option of hiding the video of other participants, if that is what you prefer.\nAs an aside, it is worth mentioning that you can turn your own video off in most platforms, and apparently this has been shown to reduce tiredness. I’m not sure it makes a lot of different for me, but for some people it clearly does:\nNow that you can remove the icon video of yourself in Google Meet I am finding online meetings far less stressful. Seeing myself (however small on the screen) for the last 15 months has been horrible. I am happy to have my video on + be seen, but not as a mirror back onto myself  — prof jenny pickerill (@JennyPickerill) June 9, 2021\nSo if you think it might help you, give it a try!\nI guess as we work out what the ‘new normal’ is, we will be creating new social rules and expectations for how we work, including in video calls. I would say please do share your video if you can – whether you are in a call of 2, class of 25 or lecture hall of 200. I think it makes all the difference to the person presenting!\nDo share your experiences in the comments below and let me know what you think."

Many people working in geospatial have heard of them, and have at least a vague idea that they do geospatial standards, even if they don’t know the details of what they do - the position I was in! Dr. Gobe Hobona, Director of Product Management, Standards at OGC, is a regular attendee at FOSS4G:UK and other geo related conferences, and recommended I come along.\nI’ve attended some Code Sprints before, including FOSS4G 2022 in Florence but I had never attended a OGC Code Sprint before. They run 4 or 5 a year, each with a different theme, and run one every year in London, usually at Geovation. Gobe had recommended I attend, and as London is relatively accessible for me (compared to Évora, Portugal; St. Louis, MO, US or Geneva, Switzerland; there other venues) I thought I would go along."

    "text": "Training DML-AI\nOne particular standard being developed was the Training ML standard, which was trying to develop automated ways of developing metadata for AI Training Data. I am no AI expert, but even I have picked up on the recent growth in AI and related terms. One key aspect of any AI is that it needs training data - in a very similar way to a supervised classification of a satellite image from remote sensing. A small sample of the data is categorised by a human, sometimes by us (Google reCAPTCHA). For example, this scene has cars in it, in this CCTV there is a bike, this image has a lake in it, etc. Then this 10-20% of the data is used to train the AL model, which then classifies the rest of the data.\nSo there are many different ways of identifying and classifying a) the training data itself (how much, resolution, etc.) and b) what training process has been applied to it (how much trained, by whom, when, what labels, etc.). There is no systematic way of recording who did what to this data. If we want people to be able to reuse this training data, we need to record this information. Ideally we want this to be machine readable so a) when data is used for training this metadata can be recorded automatically (as very few people bother to record metadata, even when it is required) and b) when the training data is used in other models, some judgement can be made about whether the training data is appropriate for the model it is being applied to.\nThis topic appealed to me as I could clearly see the benefit of this. The standard has a GitHub repository, which also makes use of the pytdml library which provides some of the tools to do this. Unfortunately the library and related tutorial didn’t work as expected - partly because there were some changes to the library the day before the session, and partly because the planned Jupyter Notebook wasn’t able to be developed in time for the session.\nThis library was in Python and I am not a Python expert. I was struggling to get it to work, and fortunately I had the benefit of Daniel’s experience to help me with this (someone else attending the code sprint). I wasn’t experienced enough to know whether I was doing something wrong, or whether the library was broken. He reassured me that it was the library that wasn’t working, rather than me getting things wrong!\nGetting help from others is one of the big benefits of attending a code sprint and I got much further with the tutorial that I would have had I been on my own. Each day we also had a “stand up” at the beginning to say briefly what we were going to do and a “brief back” at the end to say what we had done. In these people shared their experiences and I think it’s fair to say most people progressed quite slowly. Many people didn’t get a huge amount done on the first day and it was reassuring that I wasn’t the only one not making a lot of progress! In fact, someone who had a reasonable amount of experience had essentially a days work that ended up being no use! He had two routes to take to develop a certain feature - the easy route or the hard route. He started off spending a day working on the easy route and then realised it was a dead end - so had to start again on next day with the hard route! It’s very reassuring that everyone goes through this process - newbie or experienced.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the code sprint I learnt quite a bit more about Python and how it works with different packages and virtual environments. I also experience Python dependency hell, with circular dependencies meaning we had to do various unpicking’s of both my setup and the library to work out what was going on."

    "title": "Spatial R – Time to move from sp to sf",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It was about three years ago (2019) when I last wrote about the sp and sf libraries in R. The R Spatial world has moved on since then, with sp heading close to retirement now. Since 2019 I have run Introduction to Spatial Data & Using R as a GIS, and its companion course, Confident Spatial Analysis and Statistics in R & GeoDa, around 12 times teaching over 150 students. At some point I needed to make the transition from sp to sf – the question was, when?\n\n\n\nStudents at work, learning how to use R as a GIS\n\n\nStudents at work, learning how to use R as a GIS A quick recap before we get into the details – there are two main libraries that allow us to handle spatial data in R – sp and sf. sp has been around for nearly 20 years now (it first came out in 2005) and is now entering retirement. sf is much newer – it initially came out in 2016, and ever since has been gaining new functions and new users.\nsp and sf work in fundamentally different ways, specifically revolving around how they store spatial data within R. sp uses something called S4 classes, where the different elements of spatial data (coordinates/geometry, attribute table, coordinate system, etc.) are split up into different ‘slots’ and accessed using the @ symbol. sf uses S3 classes and stores spatial data all within a standard data frame, with some extra header information and a geometry column.\n\n\n\nA great table summarising the differences between sp and sf, from WeAreRLadies on Twitter.\n\n\nThe practical upshot of all of this is that I have to choose which one to teach in my courses. Pre 2019, I taught everything in sp because that was the most well used library. In March 2019 (three years ago) I moved the first part of my course from sp to sf and introduced the tmap library. This actually made R much easier to teach – because it was quicker and easier to create a map, primarily as a result of the great tmap library and the simplicity that using sf brought.\nAt this point sf was still developing, and I struggled to be able to do a point-in-polygon analysis in sf – see my previous blog post for more details! Additionally, there were still many many examples of sp code on the web, and relatively few sf examples. Therefore I decided to keep my more advanced practical 3: point in polygon analysis in sp.\nBy the time we got to Dec 2021 (last year) sf had come along way since 2019, and point in polygon analysis was now possible – so I updated my practical to reflect this. I’ve still kept the sp example, and in the introductory course I still mention sp in passing as I think it is important for any R spatial users to be aware of sp, even if they don’t actually use it. This is because I think for at least the next couple of years, there will be lots of sp examples still on Stack Exchange and elsewhere on the web, and when people find these examples, they need to be able to understand what they are any why they are different.\nMoving forward from now (2022) most of the packages that support sp (rgdal, rgeos, maptools) are being retired from the end of 2023, and everyone is being advised to move to sf. sp itself is still getting some maintenance updates, but this will only be for a limited period of time, and now everyone should be moving from sp to sf for new work. In addition, if you work with raster data, the raster library (which has many of the same dependents as sp) is transitioning to terra.\nThe We Are R Ladies group on Twitter did a very good Twitter thread about these changes – do check it out at https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies/status/1469286521874300939.\n\nMy introductory course is now fully transitioned to sf, and the practical is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license at https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis. I will next be running this course as part of the GeoIgnite conference in Canada, on 9th March. I will also be running this course again the future, please sign up to my mailing list to find out when I have confirmed more dates.\nNext on the list is updating the Advanced course, Confident Spatial Analysis and Statistics in R & GeoDa and moving this from sp to sf, which is going to be quite a job. A summer project, perhaps….!"

    "text": "I’ve been thinking for a bit of time that I need to redo my website as some of the pages had evolved a bit, and were getting a bit too long. What you see now is what I have come up with:\n\nI also took the opportunity to ‘rebrand’ myself. Previously I’d used the name Geospatial Training Solutions to market my freelance work. I was never completely happy with the name - it was a bit long and a bit generic - and after some thought I decided I would be better trading under my own name - Nick Bearman - as that is a name already known in the GIS community and it is me that I am selling. I am freelance and have no current plans to expand or to hire other people - I am just me!\nAnyway, once I’d made that decision, the question was how to make my new website. I’ve been using WordPress which worked reasonably well, but it has a relatively complex infrastructure under the hood (database, etc.) which:\n\nopens it up to more vulnerabilities and\nupgrading WordPress was always something that needed to be done every so often, and then I had to make sure everything worked as I wanted.\n\nI looked around and found various examples that were similar to what I wanted to achieve:\n\nKate Berg / Pokateo https://pokateomaps.com Wix\nJames Cheshire https://jcheshire.com/ WordPress\nMike Spencer https://mikerspencer.com/ Start Bootstrap - Agency (using Respond.js)\nAlessia Calafiore https://aelissa.github.io/ Hydejack theme on Jekyll\nCaitlin Robinson https://www.caitlin-h-robinson.com/ Wix\nAndy Kirk https://visualisingdata.com/ WordPress\nRobin Wilson https://rtwilson.com Jekyll\n\nI mostly used these to think about content, but it was also helpful to consider the different technologies as well. More people were using WordPress that I thought, and often they were not ‘obviously’ WordPress sites. I wanted something simple, and certainly something I could update easily. Easy of updating was a common theme! To quote Pokateo / Kate:\n\n\n\nFrom https://x.com/pokateo_maps/status/1473766842661539840\n\n\nAt this point, Quarto had been released and they had some interesting possibilities for websites. I’d dabbled a bit with Quarto for PDF documents and websites (including A geographer’s introduction to QGIS & R) after using RMarkdown for several years. Quarto looked ideal, so I started experimenting with it. It is plain text, and can work with GitHub, which I am using fairly regularly.\nQuarto also has a very good website, with lots of examples including creating a website https://quarto.org/docs/websites/ and you can also choose from a variety of different themes https://bootswatch.com/.\nAfter various rounds of development, I came up with this site, https://nickbearman.github.io/. It is (I hope) a simple site which has what I need on it. It also supports blogs, which I do contribute to semi-regularly. It is also all static pages, so once it is updated it can just sit there and doesn’t need any database provision or anything else to run. The new site also incorporated a search, which is handy.\nYou can host it through GitHub Pages, and there are various options to automatically compile it using continuous integration, but I decided to keep things simple, to compile the site locally and the push to GitHub. Sometimes the potential to automate things isn’t worth the time to set it up!\n\n\n\nfrom https://xkcd.com/1205 CC license\n\n\nTransferring my blog posts from WordPress (geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk and nickbearman.me.uk) was a bit of a faff but it is getting there. It is a work in progress. I have found a semi-automated way of doing this, but it will still take some time. I’m also trying to extract a static copy of the WordPress sites for archiving, with the Simpy Static WordPress plugin looking useful.\nI also used to have a contact form, which I received some useful contacts through so I wanted to include this. Quarto as such doesn’t include such a form, as there is no interaction, but I had a brainwave and decided to use a Google Forms instead. We’ve used these a lot at OSGeo:UK and they work really well.\nI hope you found this useful - do let me know what you think!\nAnd if you want to learn more about GIS, checkout my new Training Courses page and if you want a bespoke course, make use of my new Contact Form!"

The ICC (not to be confused with the International Cricket Council!) is held every two years by the International Cartographic Association (ICA). It’s a global conference, and this is the second time it has taken place in South Africa, previously being hosted in Durban in 2003.\nThe conference covers everything under the umbrella of Cartography and GIScience, with papers ranging from user assessments to theoretical discussions, covering topics as wide as cartographic methods, generalisation, COVID, navigation, education, spatial data infrastructures and many many other topics. There is plenty of overlap with the Cartography and Geographic Information Science journal (CaGIS Journal) and a number of us from the academic board were attending to present our work, connect with authors and discover new articles. I work as Cartographic Editor for CaGIS, and it was great to see some published work presented, and discover new authors who might write for the journal."

Jakub Wabiński developed a 3D printed tactile model which has been published in CaGIS and Jan Brus and Radek Barvir presented a process to 3D print models with conductive elements so users can press on certain locations which then prompts a mobile phone to play a verbal recording describing that feature.\n\nThe 3D model uses conductive strips to link the touch on designated areas of the 3D model to the tablet underneath, which then pays the relevant audio narration. This allows many different relatively cheap 3D printed models to be used with one tablet."

    "text": "UN Acronym Soup\nThe ICA is quite a large organisation with a long history, and has good links with a number of United Nations (UN) groups and initiatives, including UN GGIM - UN Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management and UN IGIF - Integrated Geospatial Information Framework. The IGIF is a multidimensional framework that provides countries with a basis for developing, integrating, strengthening, and benefiting from geospatial information management. There is a risk of drowning in acronym soup when it comes to working with the UN, and I had some great discussions when asking a number of people how UN groups and initiatives like GGIM or IGIF have made an impact in the real world. I had a range of different answers, from ‘I have no idea!’ to ‘having these programmes is better than nothing, so they probably have some impact’ to some much more detailed responses (see below).\nTo me, it was certainly clear that the UN could do a better job of explaining what it is doing in the area of geospatial in a way that can be easily understood. However, there are some great outputs from a variety of UN departments. Firstly, there are the Sustainable Development Goals, which is probably one of their most well known activities:\n\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals are often illustrated using this image, or a variation of it. Originally from https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/12/sustainable-development-goals-kick-off-with-start-of-new-year/.\nThese are something many people have heard of, and provide a series of targets to help all countries develop sustainably. Many others can describe them better than I can (see the UN, Concern), one of the keynote presentations at the conference from Greg Scott and even Google)) but one striking image is the discussion of how to measure the progress in achieving these goals, and the fact that for a number of the goals some countries are actually going backwards. Managing the data for these is a key issue, and a number of goals are quite difficult to measure, with some countries not having the data to be able to measure the progress (or lack thereof). It is possible that in comes cases this may be deliberate (for example, China reducing the number of statistics they publish because they were showing a bad message) but I think in most of the cases it is because a) the goals are tricky to measure and b) they often require specific resources which may not be available.\nReturning to UN GGIM & IGIF, accessibility of data is one of the key focus areas of the UN GGIM. One of their core aims is helping all countries develop their spatial data infrastructures, that is the national organisations that manage, maintain and make accessible their spatial data. The UN IGIF is a framework that will help countries in this process - highlighting best practice and examples of how to do this. Of course every country is at a different stage in the process, but from discussions at the ICC, every country is keen to progress their work.\nGobe Hobona from the OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) gave me a very good explanation of IGIF, which formed part of the description above. He also compared it to INSPIRE, which is the European Union (EU) initiative on spatial data infrastructure, and is probably 10-15 years ahead of IGIF. INSPIRE has provided a framework for structuring spatial data and metadata across the EU, and therefore making data (including spatial data) much more accessible by providing information about it in a structured way. Similar initiatives exist in the UK, for example on the data.gov.uk site - you can search for many different UK government related data sets there, and one of the key underpinning structures is Gemini which makes this possible. More specifically, the Gemini standard is a profile of the ISO 19115 standard that facilitates conformance to INSPIRE metadata implementing rules. A common thread across many of the geospatial data initiatives and frameworks is that they make use of OGC Standards."

    "text": "Mapping for a Sustainable World\nAnother great output from the UN is Mapping for a Sustainable World, which is a fantastic publication from a collaboration from the UN and the ICA (ICC). It’s a free book, available as a PDF, covering two main aims. Firstly, it discusses how maps can be used to help monitor progress across all (13) sustainable development goals, for example Goal 5: Gender Equality.\n\nAs example of applying spatial data to the Sustainable Development Goals. Page 54 & 55 from Mapping for a Sustainable World.\nAs well as discussing the availability of spatial data, it also covers practically every key aspect of working with spatial data and GIS (projections, MAUP, classification, scale, generalisation, colour, typography and so on), it also gives examples of 14 different types of map (thematic, nominal, choropleth, etc.) and discusses different environments for map use (both in terms of audience and medium).\nI was fortunate enough to meet one of the co authors, Britta Ricker, at the CaGIS reception, and heard about some of the challenges in pulling this book together, including methods that are not well known, but potentially very useful (e.g. dasymetric mapping), and UN’s approach to boundaries (e.g how to show disputed areas such as Tiwain, Crimea, Israel/Palestine, etc.). This is a well known geographical issue, as discussed shown in MapTiler, Google, Apple Maps, and even as discussed by James Cheshire on Christmas decorations! The UN also has a standard detailing these issues, as well as maps people can use themselves, including official UN boundaries in their web maps.\nThey had some print copies available in English and French at the conference, and both can be downloaded as PDFs for free from https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826?ln=en0.\nAs well as seeing a wide range of presentations across the whole range of Cartography and GIScience (let me know if you’re interested in publishing in CaGIS!), it was great to meet and network with a whole range of people passionate about cartography and GIScience from around the world. This conference also included a record proportion of attendees from both the African continent (450 and South Africa itself (385), which was fantastic to see (stats from map of attendee home country on https://icc2023.org/). A number of those I spoke to said they would be unable to attend if the conference was outside Africa due to funding restrictions, so it was great for them to have this opportunity."

    "text": "On PostGIS day last week, Thurs 17th Nov, we ran FOSS4G:UK Local 2022. We were trying out a new model, with the conference distributed over 9 different physical venues (and online). I chaired three amazing keynotes, which were streamed to all the venues and on the internet. We then had 38 local presentations across the nine venues, with most of them streamed and recorded.\n\nOverall the day went really well, and we had some great feedback from participants and presenters. One great aspect was once the presentations were completed, they were available on YouTube more or less instantly.\nWe had 246 people attending in person, and I think reached about another 50 online. Anyone could watch the streams online so it’s tricky to know exactly, but the first keynote had about 100 views as it finished, so assuming some double counting (people in the rooms who were on the YouTube stream) I think we can say we reached about 300 people. This is much greater than our usual in person conferences so I’m pleased to say we managed to increase our reach and get more people involved in FOSS4G:UK.\n\n\n\n(Some of) the local venues, including Keyworth, Glasgow, Leeds, London, Cardiff and Southampton (we also had Bovey Tracy, Bristol and Manchester, not shown)\n\n\nOur multi venue streaming didn’t quite work out as planned initially – our first session had some technical problems so a number of the talks didn’t stream. But everyone was very forgiving, so thanks to all the good will in the community.\nFor the keynotes, we had a Jitsi meeting which each of the venues and presentors joined. We could then share cameras as usual in a video conferencing meeting, and it was great to see all of the venues share their cameras in the welcome section:\nThe Jitsi call was then streamed to YouTube. We then collated questions via the YouTube chat and the Matrix room we had running. Theoretically we people could have asked questions in the room (relayed via the Admin WhatsApp group we were running) but it was easier for people to type directly in the Matrix room or YouTube chat, even if they were physically in the room. See this post (coming soon, I will circulate to the OSGeo:UK mailing list when published) for some more technical details, and lessons learned.\nWe’re very much looking forward to the next one, and I hope you can be involved – join the OSGeo:UK mailing list to stay up to date."

    "text": "Last week I attended the first ESRI UK Annual Conference (17th May) and the first GEO Business conference (18th & 19th May) for three years (although GEO Business had a conference last autumn, which I didn’t manage to attend). It was great to be back at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre for the ESRI UK Annual Conference – it is always a great opportunity to meet colleagues working in GIS in the UK across all industries. Clearly open source didn’t feature that much (!) but all of the ESRI tools were showcased and it was a great opportunity to see what is coming up over the next year.\n\n\n\nESRI UK Annual Conference at QEII Centre, Westminster, London\n\n\nESRI UK Annual Conference at QEII Centre, Westminster, London Sustainability was the key theme of the conference, “GIS – Creating a Sustainable Future”, with the Met Office delivering the keynote focusing on climate change. I actually missed their presentation (a long train journey!) but hearing from other participants it sounded a good presentation, although there was the question of how we turn talk about climate change at the conference into action that makes a real difference in the world.\nESRI were very keen to push the ArcGIS Suite as a set of capabilities and focusing on what you can do with their tools, rather than the tools themselves. Highlights include new graph data structures now available in ArcGIS Pro, the versatility of LiDAR data and ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online, ESRI’s response to Google Earth Engine allowing processing of large satellite data in the cloud. On that note, ArcGIS Online was first launched ten years ago – which was a slight shock to many attendees! It has gone from strength to strength – and I do like how the ArcGIS products have made GIS more accessible to new users.\nArcGIS Hub also featured prominaty as a way of collating information and making it avaialbe to non-GIS users. We also heard about deep learning models being features in the Living Atlas, real time vechicle tracking (although interestingly no mention of ethics), and greater links with AutoDesk billed as ArcGIS GeoBIM. ESRI are also very keen on pushing greater use of the cloud – either provided through ESRI’s owns services, or, longer term, hosting the various ArcGIS products on the cloud yourself. We saw a great semo of ArcGIS Geoanalytics running a Python Notebook on databricks.\nFinally, we had various mentions of ‘digital twins’. I remember the last GEO Business conference I went to in 2019 there was a lot of talk about digital twins, but nobody had actually created and used one. Now, a number of people have. One example was a model of buildings in London including information on how much water might be needed by the fire brigade to extinguish a blaze in a specific building and whether the water supply network could supply the needed amount of water. A few people weren’t convinced these were digital twins – as the key definition of a digital twin is that it includes real time updates. However, ‘real-time’ depends a bit on what temporal scale you are working to – and the amount of water needed to extinguish a blaze in a specific building probably wouldn’t change that much – so I think this is very case dependent.\nGEO Business 2022 at ExCeL, London I also attended the GEO Business conference out at ExCeL on the following day. Again, this was a great networking opportunity, although with a slightly different subset of the geospatial community. I went to a couple of very interesting applications talks – including one from the Met Office by Anthony Veal, who was working on a pilot project to increase the rated capacity of overhead electricity lines depending on the weather. Currently, overhead lines are rated for their maximum capacity based on a worse case weather scenario, which is rarely reached. Heat is the main limiting factor on the lines, with wind being the primary mitigating factor. This project is working on moving from a static worst case scenario limit to dynamic limits based on the current wind conditions. It is still in relatively early stages, with one case study, but shows a potentially significant increase in capacity at certain times. This, arguably, could be considered a digital twin with its’ real time data but the Met Office didn’t use this term.\n\n\n\nGEO Business 2022 at ExCeL, London\n\n\nDoug Specht also gave an excellent talk on Teaching Geospatial Ethics, and how he approaches this with his audience of students who are not geographers, but are often asked to create maps. He summarised the issues as a very nice three principles:\n\nNo visualisation is neutral\nPlatforms have politics\nAll perspectives are partial\n\nThis works very well for this students – journalists, writers and communication – and works as a great first step before looking at geospatial ethics frameworks like the Locus Charter.\nCloud processing also cropped up a lot at GEO Business, with many of the companies, large and small, offering new cloud based services for working with LiDAR point clouds, aerial photos and drones. There was also a nice expansion of engaging others with GIS and highlight how useful it can be across all professions – something I strongly believe in and see every day.\nOverall it was a great couple of days, with lots to think about. Please do add your comments in below, and if you are interested in finding out how GIS could benefit your work, please check out my book GIS: Research Methods, the GIS courses I offer or reach out if you would like a chat."

    "text": "“That is the question.”\n(Apologies to anyone who has studied English Literature, at any level!)\nWith nearly everyone participating in more and move video calls, “to share video or not to share video” is, indeed, the question. When participating in an online conference, should the audience members share their video?\nWe have all attended loads of video conferencing calls over the last 15 months, and I’ve been no expectation to this. I attended two conferences recently, and one thing that struck me was whether the audience members have their cameras on.\nWhen I’m running a training course or presenting, I really love to be able to see people’s faces – so I can see who I am talking to. Of course, I realise this isn’t always possible or something the participants want to do (either because of bandwidth limitations, not having a suitable home environment [although this is less of an issue with virtual backgrounds now] or many other reasons). Therefore when I am running a course I explicitly say at the beginning:\n“If you can have your video on and would like to, please do. I really like to be able to see people. However if you have limited bandwidth, or another reason why you don’t want to share your video, that is fine as well.”\nWith this approach 9 out of 10 people usually put their video on and it makes it a much better experience for me (and, I think for them).\n\n\n\nParticipants in one of my training courses sharing their videos\n\n\nI recently attended two conferences (AGILE 2021 and Coding in the Open), where only the people presenting shared their video, and the attendees did not. There have been many conferences like this, and at some conferences attendees do not have a choice (e.g. if you are using Zoom Webinar, the audience can not share their video).\nHowever for these conferences, there was a choice (AGILE used a standard Zoom room, and Coding in the Open used Bluejeans). For AGILE, the organisers asked participants to turn on their cameras for a group photo! About two-thirds or so of people did turn their cameras on the for photo. However as soon as the photo was done, people turned their cameras off again.\n\n\n\nOur AGILE group photo (1 of 2)\n\n\nThere seems to be an unwritten rule that the audience have their cameras off, and I have seen this is many other conferences as well.\n\n\n\nThe blank boxes (with names and initials removed)\n\n\nPersonally, I don’t really like this, as all you get to see of the other people on the call are black boxes. Yes, you can turn off the blank boxes, but if I am presenting, I like to be able to see who I am presenting to, and if I am in the audience, I also like to see who the audience are.\nThe other conference I attended was Coding in the Open, and this was run on Bluejeans. Here the attendees were asked to turn of their video because of bandwidth. This is often a worrying concern, and here around 150 had signed up for the free conference, and the organisers were very worried that 150 people joining the call with video might stretch the limits of the platform. In the end, typically we had 40-50 people in each session, so wouldn’t have been an issue.\nThis is a very common concern for organisers, and compounded by the fact that for free events, often only one third or one half of the people who sign up actually appear. The question then is how much capacity do you need for this event, with additional capacity often costing more money. This is a discussion for another time though.\nI did a rough show of hands in the session, and it seems most people would prefer to see the audience, whether they are in the audience or the presenter. Additionally, most programs have the option of hiding the video of other participants, if that is what you prefer.\nAs an aside, it is worth mentioning that you can turn your own video off in most platforms, and apparently this has been shown to reduce tiredness. I’m not sure it makes a lot of different for me, but for some people it clearly does:\nNow that you can remove the icon video of yourself in Google Meet I am finding online meetings far less stressful. Seeing myself (however small on the screen) for the last 15 months has been horrible. I am happy to have my video on + be seen, but not as a mirror back onto myself  — prof jenny pickerill (@JennyPickerill) June 9, 2021\nSo if you think it might help you, give it a try!\nI guess as we work out what the ‘new normal’ is, we will be creating new social rules and expectations for how we work, including in video calls. I would say please do share your video if you can – whether you are in a call of 2, class of 25 or lecture hall of 200. I think it makes all the difference to the person presenting!\nDo share your experiences in the comments below and let me know what you think."

    "text": "I’ve recently come across a new piece of software that could revolutionise communication – and yes, you have probably heard that before, in many articles on the Internet! However this one might actually be useful (although maybe not revolutionary yet), and be a significant improvement on the many different systems we have for instant messaging (IM). At the last count I regularly use Teams, Slack, WhatsApp and Signal and also sometimes use texts, Skype, Facebook Messenger, Telegram for IM, and there are probably some others I have forgotten as well.\nThis is really helpful, to avoid situations like this:\n\n\n\nXKCD explaining why a system like Matrix is important\n\n\nMatrix is something that might be able to replace all of these, and bring them into one interface, so you can have all of your IM communication in one piece of software. Matrix is an open source, distributed protocol for instant message communication. It’s a bit like email, but for IM. The email analogy works really well – because Matrix is the protocol (like email) and you can get many different clients, like you can for email (Outlook, Thunderbird, Gmail, …). You also have a Matrix address, much like an email address.\nWithin Matrix you also can have specific chat rooms (think like Slack Channels, IRC rooms, Teams teams, etc.) as well as 1 to 1 messaging. The big advantages for me are that it is open source (the only open source option for this, I believe) as well as being end-to-end encrypted. It also has bridges which allow you to join in other platforms from your Matrix account, and this is the big thing for me. Now when people send me messages in WhatsApp, Signal, Teams, Slack or anywhere else, I can a) actually find their message easily when I hear a sound and b) reply to it all in one place!\nThe other key bit of the puzzle is the client. I use a program called Element, which is one of the main clients for Matrix. There are others available as well, and you can use whichever one you like. You can also switch between platforms and all your messages and rooms you have joined will still be there.\nThis is my Matrix address: @nick:nickbearman.ems.host and if you go to https://matrix.to/#/#nick:nickbearman.ems.host in your web browser, this will open up the (Matrix) client of your choice (Element by default), give you the option of signing up for an account on Matrix and then allow you to send me an instant message.\nYou can also join rooms in a similar manner, e.g. the recently created OSGeoUK chat room on Matrix, to discuss Open Source Geo things: https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org. If you are in to open source Geo, please join us there!\nThere are also lots of other resources including Matrix’s FAQ page, this post explaining what Matrix is, and this much longer post discussing how Matrix could be really useful in open source software development, and some background info on IRC too.\nMatrix also updated the XKCD comic above with their current bridges, so you can talk to all of these through Matrix!\nGive it a go and let me know how you get on!\n*For bridging to other environments, you need admin access in Teams / Slack to set this up, which requires the organisation who admins the system to allow you to use the bridges on their system!"

For those who don’t know, FOSS4G is Free and Open Source for (4) Geospatial, so all of the people involved in open source geospatial software (e.g. QGIS, R-Spatial, Geoserver, Mapserver, GRASS, etc. etc.) get together. It is a great opportunity to meet up with the community, get to know people who you might only have met online, and find out about the latest developments. There are some great write-ups online about the conference – check them out.\nI decided to travel from the UK by train to Florence, and this post is about that journey – in both senses of booking it, and travelling it. I wanted to do this a) to see if it was possible and how easy it was, and b) to reduce my carbon footprint by getting the train rather than flying. I’ve also got some photos of my trip on Twitter.\nThe first place to spend a bit of time is seat61.com – this is a great website run by Mark Smith who does all sorts of train travel across the world. My trip to Florence is bit a tame compared to some of the trips on there, but it was a great resource. Seat61 directed me to Rail Europe, where I booked all of my trains beyond Paris. Working out the timings was a little complex, but with the help of suggested routes, I got something worked out.\n\nMy planned outbound itinerary was:\n\nWeymouth – London – Paris – Geneva\nnight in Geneva\nGeneva – Milan – Florence\n\nReturn:\n\nFlorence – Turin\nnight in Turin\nTurin – Paris – London – Weymouth\n\nI booked these about ~2 months beforehand (in June), and the cost breakdown was:\n\nWeymouth to London (SWR, return): £70\nLondon to Paris (Eurostar, return): £219\n\nRail Europe (out):\n\nParis to Geneva (SNCF, single): €129 ~£112.91\n(night in Geneva CHF90, ~£80.90)\nGeneva – Milan (Trenitalia): €60 ~£52.52\nMilan – Florence (Trenitalia): €39.90 ~£34.92\n\nReturn:\n\nFlorence – Turin: €50 ~£44.50\nTurin – Paris (TGV): €99 ~£86.65\nParis – London (included in return above)\nLondon – Weymouth (included in return above)\n\nBecause of the currency changes, I paid £341.95 to Rail Europe, so a total of £630.95 for my train travel.\nOne alternative I didn’t manage to find was sleeper trains. Night jet has recently gained in popularity since I booked this, so there might be some alternative routes there.\nThere is now an overnight option to Venice, but this wasn’t an option when I started looking, and Venice is a bit out of the way to get to Florence.\nMy planned itinerary got slightly mangled because of the rail strikes in the UK, so I ended up having to travel from Exeter to London (rather than Weymouth) and have a extra night stay in London – but I managed to catch the ‘Back to the Future’ musical, so the extra night had some compensations.\nBeyond that, everything went as planned and I arrived in Florence on time, at 1400 on Monday.\nThe SCNF Connect app – the equivalent of the National Rail app for France & Italy. One thing to remember – when travelling on Eurostar, the queue at St Pancras was very very long, but they were very efficient so even though there were many people there, I had plenty of time for my train – I arrived and got through the queue, check-in, security and both sets of border control (leaving UK and entering France) in 45 min.\n\nI’d also recommend the SCNF Connect app – a great app which will give you train details with updates and platforms.\nCheck out the Twitter thread for some photos of the various different trains I was on.\nIt was a great trip, and I really enjoyed it. It certainly took longer and cost more, but for me, it was worthwhile. Let me know about your train adventures!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Along with many other people from the geospatial community, I was up in London earlier this week for ESRI UK Annual Conference, GeoBusiness and Spatial Data Science Conference. It was a great couple of days, and while I didn’t manage to attend everything (limited time, money and energy!) it was great to see and hear what I did.\nESRI UK’s Annual Conference had a couple fewer streams than usual, but it was still as busy. I also managed to get into one of the over subscribed training sessions, to see what had changed in ArcGIS Online recently. Digital twins were mentioned quite a bit, developing from my blog post about last year’s conference, and the vocabulary is evolving and the focus has now shifted to how they are actually useful.\nJurassic Fibre gave a great presentation about how their as-built survey validation process made use of in field tools to collect and verify data. They were comparing what was planned to be built against what was actually built, and had some great processes for managing this. It really shows not just how important data is, but also how important how linking different teams together is important to deliver a service.\n\n\n\nDiscussions and catching-up at ESRI UK annual conference\n\n\nDiscussions and catching-up at ESRI UK annual conference I also had some really useful discussions about sharing data between platforms – some people use ArcGIS, some use QGIS, some R, and so on. Everyone has good reasons for using the software they do, and it would be a hard struggle to get everyone (in a team, group or even organisation) to use the same software – and more often that not will be a waste of time. What can be done is to help everyone make use of the same data, and / or share data in exchangeable formats.\nAccessibility also had a focus in the end keynote presentation, combined with ChatGPT. Large language models create great potential for interacting with maps and spatial data in a different way – a prototype demo showed how a user could verbally ask for information about a map, and the computer could give a verbal summary. No where near production yet, but it shows what could happen. There is a huge amount of potential here – with developing better interfaces for those suffering from visual impairment – or for better natural language interaction with maps. This linked a bit in with my PhD work, from 2008-2011, focusing on sonification, where I used sound to represent data in combination with vision. There are some videos and code demonstrating this (I’m sure the VBA code in ArcMap will no longer work, not the Google Maps API code, but the videos how how it worked!), as well as my PhD thesis itself.\nhttps://vimeo.com/22290435\nSonification – from a few years ago 😉\nWill ChatGPT replace GIS Analysts? I don’t think so, so we will all still have jobs! It will certainly change what we can do, and some jobs will change. With any LLM, you need to know how to ask the right question as well as being able to understand the answer that comes back. Ultimately the skills will be in interpreting the results, and making a judgement call about whether it is useful or not. Google revolutionised the internet when it was launched – and LLMs will be no different. As ever, we always need to be critical of maps and spatial analysis output – and ChatGPT or Bard or any other LLM will not change that. If anything, it will make it more important!\n\n“So don’t just use GIS, but use it critically.”\n\nI also popped into the Spatial Data Science Conference party in Wednesday night, and it sounds like the conference was fantastic – next time perhaps!\nGeoBusiness followed ESRI AC UK, with a huge range of geo related businesses hosting stands and presenting talks. The stands were very equipment focused, with many new drones and surveying tool available to have a look at and discuss. However I was more interested in the talks and networking opportunities. The skills shortage was again raised as an issue, with not enough people available with geospatial skills. However speaking with those at the coal faces, new graduate with geospatial skills are being tempted away with starting salaries of £5k – £10k more for similar roles outside geospatial (e.g. programming) and even more for data science roles. It’s a hard ask for someone to give up £5k – £10k a year to stay in geospatial!\n\nDeveloping skills of people coming into geospatial is something that is of particular interest to me, with a range of initiatives around training and skills development. While many users are big ESRI clients, there is certainly an increase in people wanting to use ESRI along side open source solutions – particularly QGIS. I see lots of potential for North Road’s SLYR tool, what they term: the ESRI to QGIS Compatibility Suite.\nThere are so many novel applications of GI data and one in particular caught my eye – ClearSky, a product from Aspia Space, have created a AI algorithm which converts uses cloud-penetrating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to create cloudless multispectral imaging, right across the visible and short-wave infrared spectrum. This allows a ‘cloud-free’ view of satellite imagery – an interesting and valuable resource.\nA different, but potentially equally useful application of GIS data was presented by Christopher Jackson from Advanced Infrastructure talking about geospatial tools for energy. They have created an application to help local councils estimate where it may be viable to install electric car charging points. The GIS analysis itself is not that ground breaking, as they are looking at a combination of IMD data, street width and electricity supply provision data to estimate feasibility and cost of electric car charging point installation – but the fact they think this is worth building into a product that can be sold is. It shows how vital geospatial data is and reminds me of the fact that there are still many people out there who don’t know what geospatial is. Communicating this is one thing we could all do better at.\nIt was great to see so many people, and chat about upcoming projects and opportunities, including FOSS4G:UK 2023 – watch this space(s) for more details soon: OSGeo:UK!"

    "text": "We finally have an end date for ArcMap! This has been something that has been a long time coming, but I would say is certainly due now. ArcMap final date of support for software updates and patches has been announced as Feb 2024. ESRI launched ArcGIS Pro, the replacement for ArcMap, several years ago and people have been slowly transitioning.\nArcMap holds a special place in my heart because it is the software that I learnt GIS on. I first came across it in my undergraduate Geography degree at University of Leicester in 2003 - introduced to me by a certain Prof. Nick Tate if I remember correctly. This was the first time I had come across the combination of Geography and Computer Science and the subject suited me down to the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater on, I also spent a lot of time working with ArcMap 9.2 (above), which I used in my programming skills to use VBA (Visual Basic Applications) code to create a map that made sounds - an area called sonification, which formed part of my early research interests.\nThings have certainly changed in the 20+ years since 2003. ArcMap itself progressed from version 8.3 all the way up to the now retiring version 10.8.2. Of course we have also seen the rise of open source: QGIS in particular as a competitor to ArcMap, and now potentially better than ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro, depending exactly who you are and what you are trying to-do.\nWe’ve also seen the rise (again) of scripting. With R leading the way and Python a performing a quick catch-up, the combination of easier to use software and ease of access to the benefits of scripting has seen GIS become much more accessible than it was 20 years ago. Some colleagues who have been using GIS longer than I have remember the days of AML, ArcInfo and Sun Microsystems - all of which used command line interfaces to work with data. Much of this was to handle larger data sets than was easy to do in a graphical interface with limited computer resources - much the same situation we see now with big data and bigger computers - but still with limited computer power to process that data.\nI was saddened to hear that some students are still being taught ArcMap:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom https://twitter.com/pokateo_maps/status/1747717333211373896\nFor anyone teaching GIS now, ArcMap is not the tool to teach. It has been a long hard road of transition from ArcMap and I know moving software is not easy, but if anyone is still teaching ArcMap, I very much hope this is its final year. Of course anyone who would like help transitioning, ESRI provide a range of very good materials and I also have good consultancy rates - just get in touch!\nOne constant challenge in the geospatial environment is that the tools and technologies constantly change - and we see this across the board of geospatial. My advice to anyone coming into this area is to at least keep up with the changes and have an idea of what is happening, even if you don’t use the cutting edge in your own work. Much of GIS’s power is in its versatility and you can get 80% of this benefit with only learning 20% of the tools! Also that 20% of knowledge will easily transfer between QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, online web maps and many other GIS.\nI’m really looking forward to the next 20 years, and who knows what it will hold?!\nBest of luck with your GIS work!"

    "text": "It was great to attend FOSS4G:UK South West 2024 in Bristol on 12th Nov, at OSGeo:UK’s now regular Bristol Venue, The Engine Shed. The event was a sell out and we had 62 people in the Engine Shed’s main room.\n\nThis was the first time in a while that I have been to a FOSS4G:UK as an attendee rather than as an organiser - and it made a nice difference! We had 14 great presentations, covering a whole range of topics including digitalization of railways, reproducible science, real time vessel monitoring, landscape heritage, open source funding, cloud native web apps and a whole variety of useful open source tools.\nUnfortunately I missed the first presentation - thanks Great Western Railways! - but one common theme that cropped up a lot was how social media as a tool for open source projects has changed dramatically. James Milner said that social media used to be a great way to promote his program, Terra Draw, but know he gets no where near the same impact from using social media. It’s now a bit of a big unknown, and I particularly liked how he summarised this:\n\nInterestingly, I sent out a number of social media posts to Twitter (X), Mastodon and LinkedIn, and LinkedIn got the most response, so make of that what you will! Although I think it’s fair to say LinkedIn is not universally loved, as it was memorably described as “Grindr for Business” by Andrew Bailey!\n\nTwitter (X) 1 retweet, 7 likes\nMastodon 3 boosts, 3 favorites\nLinkedIn 6 comments, 4 reposts\n\nThe presenters have also mastered the use of memes, with Matt Travis hitting home with some of the perils of waiting for large data sets to load:\n\nand of course also\n\nIt was also fantastic to get FAIR Open Science and FAIR workflows mentioned in the presentation by Richard Conway & Garin Smith from Telespazio, who are in the process of developing an exploration platform that allows researchers both to share their data, code and their methods in a reproducible form.\nI also had the opportunity to speak about GoFundGeo and talk about how OSGeo:UK is funding a range of open source geospatial projects that will have an impact in the UK. Join the OSGeo:UK mailing list or check the website to find out more.\n\n\n\nNick presenting GoFundGeo, thanks to Sam Franklin for the photo\n\n\nFinally, as ever, it was great to meet new people and network again with old friends at these events. I know of at least one contract opportunity, as well a number of potential ones and also I think some new volunteers for OSGeo:UK!\nThanks very much to all the organisers - Pascal Coulon, Alastair Graham, Sam Franklin, Dan Ormsby, Illya Sparkes-Santos, Ant Scott, as well as everyone who came along and took part.\nIf you want help or advice on any open source geospatial tool, or are interested in Introductory or Advanced GIS training in QGIS or R, please do contact me."

    "text": "I was very lucky to be able to attend FOSS4G 2024, in Belém, Brazil on 2nd - 8th December 2024. Belém is a fantastic city, and due to host COP30 in November 2025, with lots of construction on going. FOSS4G has a wonderful community and a great variety of talks - have a look at the agenda to see the different topics under discussion.\n\n\n\nTri-lingual welcome, in Portugese, Spanish and English at FOSS4G 2024\n\n\nThe first two days were workshops, and I attended XYZ Cloud MAPPing 101 presented by Dennis Bauszus, and Community Drone Mapping by Ivan Buendía Gayton. In some ways I find the workshops the most useful element of the conference because it gives you time to dig in to a specific piece of software and learn some new skills, something I am quite poor at doing during my usual ‘day job’! I learnt some new useful skills in both workshops. Dennis has also shared the XYZ Mapping workshop materials if you have more discipline than me(!) and can work through it on your own:\n\nMore details on the app itself\nStart with Getting started\nThen look at the workshop\n\nThe Drone workshop was also fascinating, and Ivan did a great job of both teaching us how to fly a drone (easier than I thought) and how to help local communities leverage the power of drones (& wider GIS skills) for their own benefit.\n\nThe main conference itself was in the Hanger Convention Centre and it was a great international conference. The laid back approach of FOSS4G always creates a lovely atmosphere and it was a great opportunity to get to know new people in the FOSS4G world, and catch up with people I have met at previous events. Community is one of the key things that I love about this group, with people very willing to help each other out. Uber is a key method of transportation in Brazil, and with a number of the evening social events in the city centre, we usually clubbed together at the hotel reception for an Uber to get us there, and back afterwards!\nThe variety of talks was incredible, with fascinating applications of FOSS4G tools, discussions on the interaction of academia and FOSS4G and personal reflections on people’s FOSS4G journeys. I particularly Kim Durante’s talk on FAIR Principles for Geospatial Data Curation which might have some very useful ideas for a project I am working on at the moment, and Veronica Andreo’s talk, From field biology to the GRASS GIS board - an open source journey about how she got involved in the GRASS GIS project.\n\nI met one lady from Brazil and this was her first international, English speaking conference. She was really enjoying herself and it was a great introduction to the FOSS4G community for her.\nOne thing that came across to me was the variety of open source projects, and how some projects seem to be doing very similar things. Two examples that come to mind are QField and Mergin Maps, both of which allow users to collect data in a QGIS project in the field on their phone, and process that data back in the office. Another pair would be QGIS and GRASS GIS, both arguably great quality Desktop GIS tools, and there are many other examples too.\nInitially I wondered why there were so many similar tools like this, when it might make more sense to combine effort and focus on one tool, rather than splitting our effort over two? However after a bit of reflection I discovered a) that often two similar tools have differences that make them more useful to different audiences. For example, QField is a more flexible field data collection tool, and Mergin Maps is easier to get up and running with. Also, b) having multiple tools reflects the market approach of encouraging development and innovation, with the best tool ‘winning’. In this context winning is not by having the highest revenues or the highest profits, but by having communities of users and developers. If a project doesn’t have a good group of users and/or a good group of developers interested in keeping the project up to date, then gradually it will fall out of use. I was not expecting to see an example of a capitalist based market in the open source community, but here it is!\nI also had the opportunity to met Katja Haferkorn, who is the coordinator for FOSSGIS e.V. FOSSGIS e.V. is the OSGeo Local Chapter for German-speaking countries - D-A-CH, i.e. Germany, Austria and the german speaking part of Switzerland. FOSSGIS e.V. is also the German local chapter for OpenStreetMap. FOSSGIS e.V. is quite unique in that they are a local chapter who has a paid coordinator - Katja - and it was fascinating to hear her experiences. As OSGeo:UK Chair, one of the questions I asked her was about diversity within Local Chapters, and OSGeo as a whole. This is an issue for them as well and it is a aspect of membership that has been challenging the whole community for a while. Katja has written a great blog post about the conference. It is in German, but Google Translate does a reasonable job of translating it into English.\n\n\n\nWorking at the Code Sprint, thanks to Felipe Barros for the photo\n\n\nThe last two days of the conference was the Code Sprint. This is a chance to meet people working on different open source GIS projects and learn how to contribute to different elements of the projects. I had a great chat with Silvina Meritano and Andrés Duhour about using R as a GIS. Silvina was keen to develop her mapping skills in R, and Andrés had already developed an R package (which he presented at the conference: osmlanduseR) and spent a bit of time learning about and contributing to the new tmap library examples. Tmap version 4 is coming out (blog post coming soon!) and I needed to updated my material for this new version. I also spent some time looking at the Las Calles De Las Mujeres project, which looks at the proportion of streets named after women (rather than men) in a range of Spanish speaking countries. Silvina and I had a go at creating a version in R that could automate some more of the process to apply this to different cities in English speaking countries.\nThe internet connection at the code sprint was a little variable, so we had some challenges and had to resort to using the “sneaker net” occasionally - using a USB stick to transfer data between us! Fortunately we never had to resort to playing truco - a card game played in Argentina when the internet doesn’t work and you have nothing else to do!\n\n\n\nConference group photo\n\n\nThanks very much to everyone involved in organising the conference. Many more photos are on Flickr. The conference was a fantastic experience, and if you ever have the opportunity to go to a FOSS4G conference, anywhere, do take it!\nIf you want help or advice on any open source geospatial tool, or are interested in Introductory or Advanced GIS training in QGIS or R, please do contact me."

    "title": "tmap version 4 released!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "tmap version 4 has now been released, and is now available on CRAN. It has a whole range of new features, which we will explore in this blog post.\n\n\n\n\nIf those words above mean nothing to you, a quick recap: tmap is a library used in R to make maps. I use it in my Introduction to Spatial Data and Using R as a GIS training course so if you have attended one of those, you have already used it. If you are interested in learning more, check out my Training Courses or my Training Materials\n\n\ntmap’s maintainer, Martijn Tennekes, has been working on v4 for a number of years, and has quite a few changes under the hood.\nFrom our point of view (people who are new-ish to R, and/or tmap) the code to make maps has changed slightly. Martijn has put in a lot of ‘helper’ information for people transitioning from v3 to v4, so all your code will still work.\nFor basic maps, qtm() hasn’t changed at all; although you will notice that the defaults have changed:\n\n\n\ntmap v3: qtm(sthelens, fill=\"Burglary\")\n\n\n\n\ntmap v4: qtm(sthelens, fill=\"Burglary\")\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, tm_shape and tm_polygons are the same for a basic map, but again the defaults have changed.\nHowever, when you get to doing slightly more advanced things with tm_shape, for example specifying colours, the code has changed slightly:\ntmap v3:\ntm_shape(LSOA) +\n    tm_polygons(\"Age00to04\", title = \"Aged 0 to 4\", palette = \"Greens\", style = \"jenks\") +\n    tm_layout(legend.title.size = 0.8)\ntmap v4:\n  tm_shape(LSOA) +\n    tm_polygons(fill = \"Age00to04\",\n                fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(values = \"brewer.greens\", style = \"jenks\"),\n                fill.legend = tm_legend(title.size = 0.8))\nOne specific thing of note is that there is a much wider selection of colour pallets available than the Brewer pallets. As such, we now need to specify brewer.greens rather than just Greens. However we do get a handy note if we forget:\n[cols4all] color palettes: use palettes from the R package cols4all. Run\n`cols4all::c4a_gui()` to explore them. The old palette name \"Greens\" is\nnamed \"brewer.greens\"\nMultiple palettes called \"greens\" found: \"brewer.greens\", \"matplotlib.greens\". \nThe first one, \"brewer.greens\", is returned.\n\nMartijn has designed the library to be backwards compatible, and if you do try using some v3 code with v4, it will still run and create your map, and give you some handy advice:\ntm_shape(LSOA) +\n   tm_polygons(\"Age00to04\", title = \"Aged 0 to 4\", palette = \"Greens\", style = \"jenks\") +\n   tm_layout(legend.title.size = 0.8)\n\n── tmap v3 code detected ────────────────────────────────────────────────\n[v3-&gt;v4] `tm_polygons()`: instead of `style = \"jenks\"`, use fill.scale =\n`tm_scale_intervals()`.\nℹ Migrate the argument(s) 'style', 'palette' (rename to 'values') to\n  'tm_scale_intervals(&lt;HERE&gt;)'\n[v3-&gt;v4] `tm_polygons()`: migrate the argument(s) related to the legend\nof the visual variable `fill` namely 'title' to 'fill.legend =\ntm_legend(&lt;HERE&gt;)'\nAdditionally, when dealing with the layout, legend and so on, things are a bit different:\ntmap v3:\n  tm_shape(LSOA) +\n    #Set colours and classification methods\n    tm_polygons(\"Total\", title = \"Total Population\", palette = \"Greens\",\n                style = \"equal\") +\n    #Add scale bar\n    tm_scale_bar(width = 0.22, position = c(0.05, 0.18)) +\n    #Add compass\n    tm_compass(position = c(0.3, 0.07)) +\n    #Set layout details\n    tm_layout(frame = F, title = \"Liverpool\", title.size = 2,\n              title.position = c(0.7, \"top\"))\ntmap v4:\n  tm_shape(LSOA) +\n    #set column, colours and classification method\n    tm_polygons(fill = \"Age00to04\",\n                fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(values = \"brewer.greens\", style = \"jenks\"),\n                fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Aged 0 to 4\", size = 0.8)) +\n    #add scale bar\n    tm_scalebar(position = c(0.1, 0.1)) + \n    #north arrow\n    tm_compass(size = 1.5, position = c(0.1, 0.3)) +\n    #Set title details\n    tm_title(\"Total Population of Liverpool, 2021\")\nAll of this redesign is in aid of better flexibility. For example, in v3 we were limited to tm_polygons(), tm_lines(), tm_symbols(), and tm_raster() (and their derivatives such as tm_borders() and tm_dots()). But with v4, these are easily extendible - so we can have things like tm_cartogram(), tm_donuts() and so on. Many of these are still in development but it opens up a much wider range of options.\nIn terms of how we show maps, v3 had plot and view modes, but this new framework makes it possible to add other modes as well.\nEqually, tmap is based on sf and stars, but the new framework will make it easier to work with other spatial classes, such as SpatRaster and SpatVector from terra.\nA nice overview for those already familiar with tmap is at http://mtennekes.github.io/tmap4/ (originally posted in 2021). The website also had a new range of tutorials under Basics and Advanced which are in the process of being developed.\nThe fact the tutorials (and the whole website) are built using pkgdown means that it is very easy to open the relevant page on GitHub and make changes. For example, I added a fixed breaks example to the Basic Scales page.\nThis also featured at the FOSS4G Code Sprint (Brazil) where Andrés Duhour and I updated the ggplot2 comparison article.\nTennekes M (2018). “tmap: Thematic Maps in R.” Journal of Statistical Software, 84(6), 1–39. doi:10.18637/jss.v084.i06.\nIf you want to learn how to use tmap, do have a look at my Introductory or Advanced GIS training in R, or if you have any questions, please do contact me."

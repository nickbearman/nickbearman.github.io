  title: "Training Courses"

I offer a variety of training courses on GIS and spatial data, including introductory and advanced training using QGIS and R. My training is designed to both teach you about GIS itself and how to use the software to do make maps and perform spatial analysis.

My courses are constantly being developed to take advantage of the latest changes in QGIS and R. Below is a list of the courses coming up, and a link to sign up (where available). If you would like a course run for a group of you, then please [contact me](index.html) discuss your needs and for a quote.

If a course does not have a date, then please join my [mailing list](mailing-list.html) to hear when new dates are confirmed.

"Nice balance of theory and practice. Also useful to learn what to look for if things go wrong. Content was flexible to include what might be useful for our work." Vickie, Analyst, Public Health Wales.

## Other Courses

I have also run a number of other courses, usually based on the four courses above and tweaked for a bespoke audience (examples include Public Health Wales, Essex Summer School, UEA International Development).

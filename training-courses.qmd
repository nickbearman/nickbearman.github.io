I offer a variety of training courses on GIS and spatial data, both in person and online. I offer Introductory and Advanced Training in QGIS and R. My training is designed to both teach you about GIS itself and how to use the software to do make maps and perform spatial analysis.

Below is a list of the courses coming up, and a link to sign up (where available). If you would like to participate in any of the courses, please either email nick\@geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk or use the contact form on this website.

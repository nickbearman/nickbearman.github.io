### Introduction to Spatial Data and Using R as a GIS {#introduction-to-spatial-data-using-r-as-a-gis}

::: columns
:::: {.column width="58%"}

In this two half day course we will explore how to use R to import, manage and process spatial data. We will also cover the process of making choropleth maps, as well as some basic spatial analysis. Finally, we will cover the use of loops to make multiple maps quickly and easily, one of the major benefits of using a scripting language to make maps, rather than traditional graphic point-and-click interface. *[More details](files/intro-to-r-promo.pdf)*.

No previous experience of coding is required, although participants would benefit from some experience of using spatial data (e.g. Google Maps).

[Tue 28th and Wed 29th Apr 2026, 10am – 1pm (UK/London), online, NCRM](https://www.ncrm.ac.uk/training/show.php?article=14372)

### Advanced R as a GIS: Spatial Analysis and Statistics {#advanced-R-as-a-gis-spatial-analysis-and-statistics}

::: columns
:::: {.column width="55%"}

In this two part course we will show you how to prepare and conduct spatial analysis on a variety of spatial data in R, including a range of spatial overlays and data processing techniques. We will also cover how to use GeoDa to perform exploratory spatial data analysis, including making use of linked displays and measures of spatial autocorrelation and clustering. *[More details](files/advanced-r-promo.pdf)*.

*This course can follow-on from the [Introduction to Spatial Data & Using R as a GIS](#introduction-to-spatial-data-using-r-as-a-gis) course above, or be run independently if participants have some previous knowledge of R / RStudio and spatial data.*

<!-- *This course used to be called **Confident Spatial Analysis and Statistics in R & GeoDa**, and is the same material with a new, better, less wordy name!* -->

### Introduction to QGIS: Understanding and Presenting Spatial Data

In this two part introductory course we will give you an overview on how GIS works, and what we can and can’t do with spatial data. We assume no prior knowledge of GIS and will explain how to get data into the GIS as well as how to produce maps using your own data. *[More details](files/intro-to-qgis-promo.pdf).*

*This course requires no prior knowledge of GIS or spatial data. A level of basic computer experience is required; such as using websites, Word and saving & moving files.*

*Attendees on this course can choose to receive a [Certificate of Completion](https://www.qgis.org/community/certification/), certified by QGIS for a donation of €20. [Geospatial Training Solutions / Nick Bearman](https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/certifyingorganisation/geospatial-training-solutions/) is a QGIS approved training organisation, and a donation of €20 for each participant will be made to the QGIS Foundation, supporting the development of QGIS.*

### Advanced QGIS: Spatial Analysis

This advanced two part course will develop your skills of using spatial data, including collating data from a variety of sources including XY coordinate data and address or postcode based data. We will also cover using spatial overlays, point-in-polygon analysis and spatial joins. *[More details](files/advanced-qgis-promo.pdf).*

*This course can follow-on from the Introduction to QGIS course above, or be run independently if the participants have some previous knowledge of QGIS and spatial data.*

### Essex Summer School

#### Introduction to GIS, Geospatial Data and Spatial Analysis

In this week long (17.5 hours) course at the Essex Summer School, you will gain an in-depth knowledge of spatial data, and how it can be used in a variety of social science applications. You will learn how spatial data is structured, how and where it can be used and how and where it cannot be used. By the end of the course you will be able to apply the skills you have learnt in your own area of study, and there will be time during the course provided to start this with me available to help.

*This course is a combination of the four courses listed above, plus some additional material.*

[No dates for 2025 yet, but check out 2024 for more details](https://essexsummerschool.com/summer-school-facts/courses/ess-2024-course-list/1p-introduction-to-gis-geospatial-data-and-spatial-analysis/)

### Other Courses

I have also run a number of other courses, based around the four courses above and tweaked for a bespoke audience. I have delivered bespoke courses to a wide variety of clients including Public Health Wales, Red Bull, National Trails UK and UEA International Development. 

I also deliver bespoke GIS training one-to-one and small groups on a [consultancy](consultancy.html) basis. 

If you are interested in a bespoke course, please [contact me](index.html) for a discussion and a quote.

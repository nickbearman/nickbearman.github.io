As well as my \[Training Courses\] which you can attend in person or online, I have some stand alone training materials which you might find useful. Some of these are updated regularly, and some of them are older; I hope all of them are useful. If you have any comments, suggestions or feedback, please [let me know]().

### Material from my Training Courses

Some of the workbooks from my training courses are freely available for you to use, under a Creative Commons license. Please feel free to use and pass on!

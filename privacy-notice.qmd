## How long we keep information

We retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including to deliver our training and consultancy services, manage client relationships, and comply with our legal and contractual obligations.

For example:

- **Marketing preferences and contact details** are retained until you withdraw your consent or object to processing, unless we have another lawful basis to retain them.

- **Financial and invoicing information** is typically retained for 6 years in line with HMRC requirements.

After these periods, we will securely delete or anonymise personal data unless we are legally required to retain it for longer. In some cases, we may retain anonymised training data for statistical or analytical purposes.

## Libraries

R uses libraries to add features and different tools, such as GIS and spatial analysis. We need to install some libraries we will be using. 

- Open **RStudio**. 
- In the **Console** type in `install.packages("sf")`. 
- Then load the library by running `library(sf)`. 
- Check the output you get - red text does not always mean an error! 
- Repeat the process for the `tmap` package (`install.packages("tmap")` and then `library(tmap)`) and any other packages you need. 

*If you already have `tmap` installed, please upgrade it to the latest version. We will be using `tmap` v4 in the course. If you are not sure which version of `tmap` you are using, you can check by loading `tmap` and then running `packageVersion("tmap")`.*

If you get stuck, check out [troubleshooting](r-rstudio-library-troubleshooting.html) for some things to try. 

## Posit Cloud

If you can't get R & RStudio installed on your computer, there is another option. You can use Posit Cloud, which runs RStudio in a web browser. You can get a free account which will be enough for a short course. 

- Go to [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/).
- Choose **Sign Up** 
- Select **Learn more** under the **Cloud free** plan 
- Choose **Sign Up** and fill out the form. 
- To get started, choose **New Project** and **New RStudio Project**. *It will take a few seconds to load*.

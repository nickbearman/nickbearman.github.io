It was great to attend [FOSS4G:UK South West](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2024/bristol.html) in Bristol on 12th Nov, at OSGeo:UK's now regular Bristol Venue, The Engine Shed. The event was a sell out and we had 62 people in the Engine Shed's main room.

This was the first time in a while that I have been to a FOSS4G:UK as an attendee rather than as an organiser - and it made a nice difference! We had 14 great presentations, covering a whole range of topics including digitalization of railways, reproducible science, real time vessel monitoring, landscape heritage, open source funding, cloud native web apps and a whole variety of useful open source tools. 

Unfortunately I missed the first presentation - thanks Great Western Railways! - but one common theme that cropped up a lot was how social media as a tool for open source projects has changed dramatically. [James Milner](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2024/bristol.html) said that social media used to be a great way to promote his program, Terra Draw, but know he gets no where near the same impact from using social media. It's now a bit of a big unknown, and I particularly liked how he summarised this:

I sent out a number of social media posts to Twitter (X), Mastodon and LinkedIn, and LinkedIn got the most response, so make of that what you will! Although I think it's fair to say LinkedIn is not universally loved, as it was memorably described as "Grinder for Business"!

The presenters have also mastered the use of memes, with [Matt Travis](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2024/bristol.html) hitting home with some of the perils of waiting for large data sets to load:

and of course also

It was also fantastic to get FAIR Open Science and FAIR workflows mentioned in the presentation by [Richard Conway & Garin Smith](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2024/bristol.html) from Telespazio, who are in the process of developing an exploration platform that allows researchers both to share their data, code and their methods in a reproducible form. 

I also has the opportunity to speak about GoFundGeo and talk about how OSGeo:UK is funding a range of open source geospatial projects that will have impact in the UK. Join the [OSGeo:UK mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk) or check the [website](https://uk.osgeo.org/gofundgeo.html) to find out more. 

Finally, as ever, it was great to meet new people and network again with old friends at these events. I know of at least one contract opportunity, as well a number of potential ones and also I think some new volunteers for OSGeo:UK!

Thanks very much to all the organisers - [Pascal Coulon](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/pascalcoulon), [Alastair Graham](https://social.vivaldi.net/@ajggeoger), [Sam Franklin](https://mapstodon.space/@samfranklin), [Dan Ormsby](https://linkedin.com/in/danielormsby/), [Illya Sparkes-Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/illyasantos/), [Ant Scott](https://mastodon.social/@antscott) as well as everyone who came along and took part.
